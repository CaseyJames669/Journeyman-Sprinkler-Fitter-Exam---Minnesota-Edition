## II. Codes & Standards (National)

### A. NFPA 13 - Installation of Sprinkler Systems
- **Most heavily tested standard**
- Coverage, spacing, pipe schedule, hydraulic calculations
- Storage protection requirements
- System components and trim

### B. NFPA 25 - Inspection, Testing & Maintenance (ITM)
- **"Exam Killer" - Known as the hardest section**
- **Inspection Frequencies:**
  - Gauges (Wet): Monthly
  - Gauges (Dry/Preaction): Weekly
  - Main Drain Test: Quarterly
  - Hydrants: Annually
  - Interior Tank Inspection: Every 3 years (no corrosion protection)
  - Standpipe Flow Test: Every 5 years
- **Testing Procedures:**
  - Dry Pipe Valve Trip Test: Annually
  - Full Flow Trip Test: Every 3 years
  - Backflow Preventer Forward Flow: Annually
  - FDC Hydrostatic Test: Every 5 years
- **Pump Testing:**
  - Weekly test duration: Electric (10 min), Diesel (30 min)

### C. NFPA 14 - Standpipe & Hose Systems
- **Flow Requirements:**
  - Class I: 500 gpm (most remote), 250 gpm (each additional)
- **Pressure:** 100 psi minimum residual at most remote 2.5" outlet
- **System Types:** Automatic Wet, Automatic Dry, Manual Dry, Semiautomatic

### D. NFPA 20 - Fire Pumps
- **Components:** Eccentric reducers, pressure maintenance (jockey) pumps
- **Diesel Requirements:** Fuel tank elevation, engine specifications

### E. NFPA 24 - Underground Piping
- **Burial Depth:** 36 inches minimum (or 1 ft below frost line)
- **Thrust Blocks:** Required at elbows, tees, reducers, dead ends
- **Flushing:** Minimum flow rates by pipe size (e.g., 4" = 390 gpm @ 10 ft/sec)

### F. Other NFPA Standards
- **NFPA 22** - Water Tanks
- **NFPA 72** - Fire Alarm Systems (integration with preaction/deluge)
- **NFPA 96** - Commercial Cooking Systems
- **NFPA 17A** - Wet Chemical Systems

---

## III. Minnesota State Codes & Statutes (Override NFPA)

### A. Minnesota Statutes Chapter 299M
- **Licensing Requirements:**
  - 8,000 hours of experience required for Journeyman exam
  - License expires: June 30th annually
- **Penalties:** Working without license = Misdemeanor ($1,000 / 90 days)

### B. Minnesota Rules Part 7512
- License renewal procedures
- Continuing education (if applicable)
- Scope of practice

### C. Minnesota Amendments to NFPA Codes
- **FDC Height Requirements:** 18" to 48" (may differ from base NFPA)
- **Valve Monitoring Exceptions:** MN-specific variations
- **Any MN-adopted amendments to NFPA 13, 25, etc.**

**CRITICAL:** When MN Statutes or Amendments conflict with NFPA, **Minnesota always wins**.

## IV. Safety & General Knowledge

### A. OSHA & Workplace Safety
- **MSDS/SDS** - Material Safety Data Sheets for chemicals
- **PPE** - Personal Protective Equipment requirements
- **Fall Protection** - Scaffolding, ladder safety

### B. Hydraulic Calculations
- Principles of hydraulic design
- Water supply calculations
- Demand calculations for various occupancies

### C. Specialty Valves & Trim

---

## V. Practical Application

- **Schematic Drawings:** Interpreting system diagrams
- **Table/Chart Reading:** Using NFPA tables during exam
- **Code Application:** Applying codes to real-world scenarios
- **Troubleshooting:** Identifying system problems and solutions

---

## Exam Strategy Notes

1. **NFPA 25 (ITM)** is historically the hardest section - memorize inspection frequencies
2. **Coverage areas** (225, 130, 100 sq ft) are frequently tested
3. **Hanger spacing** questions appear multiple times
4. **MN-specific codes** always override NFPA when there's a conflict
5. **20 questions are "pilot"** - They don't count, but you won't know which ones
6. **Tables and charts** from NFPA 13 will be provided during the exam
