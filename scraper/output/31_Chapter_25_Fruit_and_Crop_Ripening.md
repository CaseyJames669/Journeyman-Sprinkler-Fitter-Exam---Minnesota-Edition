# Chapter 25 Fruit and Crop Ripening

About this chapter:Chapter 25 provides guidance that is intended to reduce the likelihood ofexplosionsresulting from improper use orhandlingof ethylene gas used for crop ripening and coloring processes. This is accomplished by regulating ethylene gas generation, regulating storage and distributionsystemsand controlling ignition sources. Design and construction offacilitiesfor fruit and crop ripening are regulated by theInternational Building Code®to reduce the impact of potential accidents on people and buildings.

Ripening processes where ethylene gas is introduced into a room to promote the ripening of fruits, vegetables and other crops shall comply with this chapter.

Exception:Mixtures of ethylene and one or more inert gases in concentrations that prevent the gas from reaching greater than 25 percent of thelower explosive limit(LEL) when released to the atmosphere.

Approvedethylene generators shall be operated and maintained in accordance withSection 2506.

Heating shall be by indirect means utilizing low-pressure steam, hot water or warm air.

Exception:Electric or fuel-fired heatersapprovedfor use in hazardous (classified) locations and that are installed and operated in accordance with the applicable provisions of NFPA 70, theInternational Mechanical Codeor theInternational Fuel Gas Code.
