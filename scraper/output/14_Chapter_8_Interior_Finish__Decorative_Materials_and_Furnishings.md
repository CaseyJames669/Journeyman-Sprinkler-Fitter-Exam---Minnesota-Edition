# Chapter 8 Interior Finish, Decorative Materials and Furnishings

About this chapter:Chapter 8 provides requirements forinterior finishes,decorative materialsand furnishings in new andexistingbuildings so that they do not significantly add to or create fire hazards in buildings. The provisions tend to focus on occupancies with specific risk characteristics, such as vulnerability of occupants, density of occupants, lack of familiarity with the building and societal expectations of importance. This chapter is consistent with Chapter 8 of theInternational Building Code®, which regulates theinterior finishesanddecorative materialsof new buildings.

The provisions of this chapter shall govern interiorfinish, interiortrim, furniture, furnishings,decorative materialsand decorative vegetation in buildings.Existingbuildings shall comply with Sections803through808. New buildings shall comply with Sections804through808, andSection 803of theInternational Building Code.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

- During the 40 kW exposure, flames shall not spread to the ceiling.
- The flame shall not spread to the outer extremity of the sample on any wall or ceiling.
- Flashover, as defined in NFPA 286, shall not occur.
- The peak heat release rate throughout the test shall not exceed 800 kW.
- The total smoke released throughout the test shall not exceed 1,000 m2.

Interior wall and ceiling finishes shall be classified in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723. Such interior finish materials shall be grouped in the following classes in accordance with their flame spread and smoke-developed indices.

- Class A: Flame spread index 0-25; smoke-developed index 0-450.
- Class B: Flame spread index 26-75; smoke-developed index 0-450.
- Class C: Flame spread index 76-200; smoke-developed index 0-450.

Exception:Materials tested in accordance with Section 803.1.1 and as indicated in Sections 803.1.3 through 803.15.

Interior wall and ceiling finishshall have aflame spread indexnot greater than that specified inTable803.3 for the group and location designated.Interior wall and ceiling finishmaterials tested in accordance with NFPA 286, and meeting the acceptance criteria of Section 803.1.1.1, shall be used where a Class A classification in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723 is required.
