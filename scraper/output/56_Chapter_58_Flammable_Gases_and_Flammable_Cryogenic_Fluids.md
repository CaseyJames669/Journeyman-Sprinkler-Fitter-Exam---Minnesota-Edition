# Chapter 58 Flammable Gases and Flammable Cryogenic Fluids

About this chapter:Chapter 58 sets requirements for thestorageanduseof flammable gases. For safety purposes, there is a limit on the quantities offlammable gasallowed percontrol area. Exceeding these limitations increases the possibility of damage to both property and individuals. The principal hazard posed byflammable gasis its ready ignitability, or even explosivity, when mixed with air in the proper proportions. Consequently, occupancies storing orhandlinglarge quantities offlammable gasare classified as GroupH-2(high hazard) by theInternational Building Code®.

The storage anduseof flammable gases andflammablecryogenic fluidsshall be in accordance with this chapter, NFPA 2 and NFPA 55.Compressed gasesshall also comply withChapter 53andcryogenic fluidsshall also comply withChapter 55.Flammablecryogenic fluidsshall comply withSection 5806. Hydrogen motor fuel-dispensingstations andrepair garagesand their associated above-ground hydrogen storagesystemsshall also be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance withChapter 23.

Exceptions:Gases used asrefrigerantsin refrigerationsystems(seeSection 605).Liquefied petroleum gases and natural gases regulated byChapter 61.Fuel-gassystemsand appliances regulated under theInternational Fuel Gas Codeother thangaseous hydrogen systemsand appliances.Pyrophoricgases in accordance withChapter 64.

- Gases used asrefrigerantsin refrigerationsystems(seeSection 605).
- Liquefied petroleum gases and natural gases regulated byChapter 61.
