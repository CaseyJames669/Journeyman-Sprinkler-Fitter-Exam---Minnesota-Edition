Exception:Thefire code officialis authorized to approve lesser separation distances if large-scale fire and fault condition testing conducted or witnessed and reported by anapprovedtesting laboratory is provided showing that a fire involving thesystemwill not adversely impact occupant egress from adjacent buildings, or adversely impact adjacent stored materials or structures.

Capacitor energy storage systemslocated outdoors shall be separated from anymeans of egressas required by thefire code officialto ensure safe egress under fire conditions, but not less than 10 feet (3048 mm).

Capacitors andcapacitor energy storage systemsshall comply with the following:

- Capacitors shall be listed in accordance with UL 1973.
- Prepackaged and preengineered stationarycapacitor energy storage systemsshall be listed in accordance with UL 9540.

Where capacitors release flammable gases during normal operating conditions,ventilationof rooms containingcapacitor energy storage systemsshall be provided in accordance with theInternational Mechanical Codeand one of the following:

- Theventilationsystemshall be designed to limit the maximum concentration offlammable gasto 25 percent of the lower flammability limit.
- Continuousventilationshall be provided at a rate of not less than 1 cubic foot per minute (cfm) per square foot [0.00508 m3/(s • m2)] of floor area, but not less than 150 cfm (4 m3/min).

The exhaustsystemshall be designed to provide air movement across all parts of the floor for gases having a vapor density greater than air and across all parts of the ceiling for gases having a vapor density less than air.

Where capacitors containliquidelectrolyte,approvedmethods and materials shall be provided for the control and neutralization of spills of electrolyte or otherhazardous materialsin areas containing capacitors as follows:

- For capacitors with free-flowing electrolyte, the method and materials shall be capable of neutralizing a spill of the total capacity from the largest cell or block to a pH between 5.0 and 9.0.
- For capacitors with immobilized electrolyte, the method and material shall be capable of neutralizing a spill of 3.0 percent of the capacity of the largest cell or block in the room to a pH between 5.0 and 9.0.
