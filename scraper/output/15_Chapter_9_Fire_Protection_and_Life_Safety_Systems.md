# Chapter 9 Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems

About this chapter:Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active fire protection equipmentsystemsto perform the functions of detecting a fire, alerting the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency, mass notification, gas detection, controlling smoke and controlling or extinguishing the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, theheightand theareaof the building, because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of theInternational Building Code®;however, this chapter also contains periodic testing criteria that are not contained in theInternational Building Code.In addition, the specialfire protection systemrequirements based on use and occupancy found inChapter 4of theInternational Building Codeare duplicated in this chapter as a user convenience.

Exception:Fire alarmand water-basedautomatic fire-extinguishing systemsshall be inspected and tested annually. Inspections and testing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in the referenced standards listed inTable901.6.1. As part of the annual inspections covered under this exception, all weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual inspections, tests, and maintenance requirements in the listed standards shall be conducted and any problems observed shall be noted.

- The supervisors in the areas to be affected have been notified.
- A tag impairmentsystemhas been implemented.
- Necessarytoolsand materials have been assembled on the impairmentsite.

Where impaired equipment is restored to normal working order, theimpairment coordinatorshall verify that all of the following procedures have been implemented:

- Necessary inspections and tests have been conducted to verify that affectedsystemsare operational.
- Supervisors have been advised that protection is restored.
- The fire department has been advised that protection is restored.
- The buildingowner/manager, insurance carrier, alarm company and other involved parties have been advised that protection is restored.
- The impairment tag has been removed.

Thefire code officialis authorized topermitthe removal ofexistingoccupant-use hose lines where both of the following conditions exist:

- The hose line would not be utilized by trained personnel or the fire department.
- The remaining outlets are compatible with local fire department fittings.

Anyfire protection systemcomponent regulated by this code that is the subject of a voluntary or mandatory recall under federal law shall be replaced withapproved,listedcomponents in compliance with the referenced standards of this code. Thefire code officialshall be notified in writing by the buildingownerwhen the recalled component parts have been replaced.

Exception:When additional sprinklers or detectors are installed in the space above the suspended ceiling.

Exception:Open-grid ceilings are allowed when the requirements of NFPA 13 for open-grid ceilings are met.

Section 903.3.1.6.1 relaxes the requirements for a hose stream allowance when the sprinklersystemis supplied by a private watersystem(well,tank, or other supply). A hose stream allowance is typically added to the sprinklersystemdemand due to concerns that thefire departmentwill draw water from a hydrant and potentially decrease the water available for sprinkler operation. With a private watersystemthis is unlikely to occur.
