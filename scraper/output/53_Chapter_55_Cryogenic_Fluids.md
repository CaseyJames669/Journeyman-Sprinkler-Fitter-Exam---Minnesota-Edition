# Chapter 55 Cryogenic Fluids

About this chapter:Chapter 55 regulates the hazards associated with the storage, use andhandlingofcryogenic fluidsthrough regulation of such things as pressure relief mechanisms and propercontainerstorage. These hazards are in addition to the code requirements that address the other hazards ofcryogenic fluidssuch as flammability and toxicity. These other characteristics are dealt with inChapter 50and other chapters, such asChapter 58and its content about flammable gases. Cryogens are hazardous because they are held at extremely low temperatures and high pressures. Manycryogenic fluids, however, are actually inert gases and would not be regulated elsewhere in this code. Cryogens are used for many applications but specifically have had widespread use in the biomedical field and in space programs.

Storage, use andhandlingofcryogenic fluidsshall comply with this chapter and NFPA 55.Cryogenic fluidsclassified ashazardous materialsshall also comply with the general requirements ofChapter 50. Partially fullcontainerscontaining residualcryogenic fluidsshall be considered as full for the purposes of the controls required.

Exceptions:Fluids used asrefrigerantsin refrigerationsystems(seeSection 605).Liquefied natural gas(LNG), which shall comply with NFPA 59A.

- Fluids used asrefrigerantsin refrigerationsystems(seeSection 605).
- Liquefied natural gas(LNG), which shall comply with NFPA 59A.

Oxidizingcryogenic fluids, including oxygen, shall comply withChapter 63, as applicable.

Flammablecryogenic fluids, including hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, shall comply with Chapters23and58, as applicable.

Inertcryogenic fluids, including argon, helium and nitrogen, shall comply with ANSI/CGA P-18.

Permitsshall be required as set forth inSection 105.6.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2.

FLAMMABLE CRYOGENIC FLUID.

The following data shall be submitted to thefire code officialwith reference to the deviation from the recognized standard with the application for approval.

- Type and use ofcontainer, equipment or device.
- Material to be stored, used or transported.
- Description showing dimensions and materials used in construction.
- Design pressure, maximumoperating pressureand test pressure.
- Type, size and setting of pressure relief devices.
- Other data requested by thefire code official.

Pressure relief devices shall be arranged to discharge unobstructed to the open air in such a manner as to prevent impingement of escaping gas on personnel,containers, equipment and adjacent structures or to enter enclosed spaces.

Exception:DOTn-specifiedcontainerswith an internal volume of 2 cubic feet (0.057 m3) or less.

Shutoff valves shall not be installed between pressure relief devices andcontainers.

Exceptions:A shutoff valve is allowed oncontainersequipped with multiple pressure relief device installations where the arrangement of the valves provides the full required flow through the minimum number of required relief devices at all times.A locking-type shutoff valve is allowed to be used upstream of the pressure relief device for service-related work performed by the supplier when in accordance with the requirements of the ASMEBoiler andPressure VesselCode.

- A shutoff valve is allowed oncontainersequipped with multiple pressure relief device installations where the arrangement of the valves provides the full required flow through the minimum number of required relief devices at all times.
- A locking-type shutoff valve is allowed to be used upstream of the pressure relief device for service-related work performed by the supplier when in accordance with the requirements of the ASMEBoiler andPressure VesselCode.

Containerinlet and outlet connections,liquid-level limit controls, valves and pressure gauges shall be identified with one of the following:

- A permanent tag or label identifying the function.
- A schematic drawing that portrays the function and designates whether the connection is to the vapor orliquidspace of thecontainer.

Where a schematic drawing is provided, it shall be attached to thecontainerand maintained in a legible condition.

Stationarycontainersshall be separated from exposure hazards in accordance with the provisions applicable to the type of fluid contained and the minimum separation distances indicated inTable5504.3.1.1.

SEPARATION OF STATIONARYCONTAINERSFROM EXPOSURE HAZARDS

| EXPOSURE | MINIMUM DISTANCE(feet) |
| Buildings, regardless of construction type | 1 |
| Buildingexits | 10 |
| Wall openings | 1 |
| Air intakes | 10 |
| Lot lines | 5 |
| Places of public assembly | 50 |
| Nonambulatory patient areas | 50 |
| Combustible materials such as paper, leaves, weeds, dry grass or debris | 15 |
| Otherhazardous materials | In accordance withChapter 50 |

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm.

The area surrounding stationarycontainersshall be provided with a means to prevent accidental discharge of fluids from endangering personnel,containers, equipment and adjacent structures or to enter enclosed spaces. The stationarycontainershall not be placed where spilled or discharged fluids will be retained around thecontainer.

Exception:These provisions shall not apply where it is determined by thefire code officialthat thecontainerdoes not constitute a hazard, after consideration of special features such as crushed rock utilized as a heat sink, topographical conditions, nature of occupancy, proximity to structures on the same or adjacent property, and the capacity and construction ofcontainersand character of fluids to be stored.

Portablecontainersin outdoor storage shall be separated from exposure hazards in accordance withTable5504.3.1.2.1.

SEPARATION OF PORTABLECONTAINERSFROM EXPOSURE HAZARDS

| EXPOSURE | MINIMUM DISTANCE(feet) |
| Buildingexits | 10 |
| Wall openings | 1 |
| Air intakes | 10 |
| Lot lines | 5 |
| Combustible materials such as paper, leaves, weeds, dry grass or debris | 15 |
| Otherhazardous materials | In accordance withChapter 50 |

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm.

The area surrounding portablecontainersshall be provided with a means to prevent accidental discharge of fluids from endangering adjacentcontainers, buildings, equipment or adjoining property.

Exception:These provisions shall not apply where it is determined by thefire code officialthat thecontainerdoes not constitute a hazard.

Indoorareas wherecryogenic fluidsare dispensed shall be ventilated in accordance with the requirements of theInternational Mechanical Codein a manner that captures any vapor at the point of generation.

Exception:Cryogenic fluidsthat can be demonstrated not to create harmful vapors.

Cryogenic containersshall be moved using anapprovedmethod. Wherecryogenic containersare moved by hand cart, hand truck or other mobile device, such carts, trucks or devices shall be designed for the secure movement of thecontainer.

Carts and trucks used to transportcryogenic containersshall be designed to provide a stable base for thecommoditiesto be transported and shall have a means of restrainingcontainersto prevent accidental dislodgement.
