# Chapter 32 High-Piled Combustible Storage

About this chapter:Chapter 32 provides guidance for reasonable protection of life from hazards associated with the storage of combustible materials in closely packed piles or on pallets, in racks or on shelves where the top of storage is greater than 12 feet in height, or 6 feet for high-hazardcommodities. It provides requirements for identifying various classes ofcommodities; and general fire and life safety features including storage arrangements, smoke and heat venting, fire departmentaccessand housekeeping and maintenance. This chapter attempts to define the potential fire severity and, in turn, determine fire and life safety protection measures needed to control and in some cases suppress a potential fire. This chapter does not cover miscellaneous combustible material storage as regulated inSection 315.

High-piled combustible storageshall be in accordance with this chapter. In addition to the requirements of this chapter, the following material-specific requirements shall apply:

1. Aerosols shall be in accordance withChapter 51.
2. Flammable andcombustible liquidsshall be in accordance withChapter 57.
3. Hazardous materialsshall be in accordance withChapter 50.
4. Storageof combustible paper records shall be in accordance with NFPA 13.
5. Storage ofcombustible fibersshall be in accordance withChapter 37.
6. Generalstorageof combustible material shall be in accordance withChapter 3.

At the time of buildingpermitapplication for new structures designed to accommodate high-piled storage or for requesting achange of occupancy/use, and at the time of application for a storagepermit, plans and specifications shall be submitted for review and approval. In addition to the information required by theInternational Building Code, thestoragepermitsubmittal shall include the information specified in this section. Theconstruction documentsshall include all of the following:

2. Usable storage height for each storage area.
3. Number of tiers within each rack, if applicable.
4. Commodityclearance between top of storage and the sprinkler deflector for each storage arrangement.
5. Aisledimensions between each storagearray.

11. Location of valves controlling the water supply of ceiling and in-rack sprinklers.
12. Type, location and specifications of smoke removal and curtain boardsystems.
13. Dimension and location of transverse andlongitudinal flue spaces.
14. Additional information regarding required design features,commodities, storage arrangement and fire protection features within thehigh-piled storage areashall be provided at the time ofpermit, where required by thefire code official.

Table3203.8 shall be used to determine thecommodityclassification for various products and materials. Products not found in the list shall be classified based on the classification descriptions in Sections3203.2through3203.6and the products they most nearly represent inTable3203.8.Table3203.8 considers the product and the packaging if listed with the item. Products with additional packaging consisting ofGroup Aplastics shall be classified in accordance withSection 3203.9.

Thecommodityclassifications are based on products with, or without, wood pallets. Where plastic pallets are used, thecommodityclassification shall be modified in accordance withSection 3203.10.

Figures 3203.9(1) and 3203.9(2) shall be used to determine thecommodityclassification based on the quantity ofGroup Aplastics in the following situations:

1. The product is not listed inTable 3203.8and containsGroup Aplastics.
2. ThecommoditycontainsGroup Aplastics and is not classified as high-hazard inTable 3203.8.
3. The product listing inTable 3203.8does not specifically include packaging, and the packaging material includesGroup Aplastics.

EVALUATION BY VOLUME OFGROUP AEXPANDED PLASTICSIN MIXEDCOMMODITIESa, b

This figure is used to determine thecommodityclassification of a mixedcommoditywithGroup Aplastics in a package orcarton, or on a pallet.The following is an example of how to apply Figure 3203.9(1): A pallet load consists of a Class IIIcommoditywith components of unexpandedGroup Aplastic and packing material of expandedGroup Aplastic. Using Equation 32-1, the weight of unexpandedGroup Aplastic is 5 percent. Using Equation 32-2, the volume of expandedGroup Aplastic is 15 percent. Thiscommodityis classified as a Class IVcommodity. If the volume of the expandedGroup Aplastic is increased to 20 percent, the classification changes to a high-hazardcommodity. Compare this result with the result from Figure 3203.9(2), and the highest classification will apply. Where the load is stored on a plastic pallet, the requirements inSection 3203.10apply.
