# Chapter 7 Fire and Smoke Protection Features

About this chapter:Chapter 7 provides requirements to maintain thefire-resistance ratingsof building elements and to limit fire spread.Section 701addresses the maintenance of andowner's responsibility for construction elements such asfire barriersandsmoke barriers. The rest of the chapter deals with various aspects that also must be maintained to achieve overallfire resistanceof the main fire- and smoke-resistive features. These include penetrations, joint protection, door and window openings, and duct and air transfer opening protection.

Exception:This exception applies to the following elements that exceed the requirements for new structures orfacilities:existingfire-resistance-rated construction,existingconstruction to resist the passage of smoke, andexistingopening protectives. Whenapprovedby thefire code official: (1) maintenance of these elements is not required; and (2) removal of these elements is permitted as long as any decommissioned equipment is clearlylabeledas such.

Thefire-resistance ratingof the followingfire-resistance-ratedconstruction shall be maintained:

1. Structural members.
2. Exterior walls.
3. Fire walls,fire barriers,fire partitions.
4. Horizontal assemblies.
5. Shaft enclosures.

Where any components in this chapter are not maintained and do not function as intended or do not have thefire resistanceor the resistance to the passage of smoke required by the code under which the building was constructed, remodeled or altered, such component(s) or portion thereof shall be deemed an unsafe condition, in accordance withSection 111.1.1. Components or portions thereof determined to be unsafe shall be repaired or replaced to conform to that code under which the building was constructed, remodeled, altered or this chapter, as deemed appropriate by thefire code official.

Where the condition of components is such that any building, structure or portion thereof presents an imminent danger to the occupants of the building, structure or portion thereof, thefire code officialshall act in accordance withSection 111.2.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

DRAFTSTOP.FIREBLOCKING.FIRE-RESISTANT JOINTSYSTEM.MEMBRANE-PENETRATION FIRESTOPSYSTEM.OPENING PROTECTIVE.SMOKE BARRIER.SMOKE PARTITION.THROUGH-PENETRATION FIRESTOPSYSTEM.

FIRE-RESISTANT JOINTSYSTEM.

MEMBRANE-PENETRATION FIRESTOPSYSTEM.

THROUGH-PENETRATION FIRESTOPSYSTEM.

Where required when the building was originally constructed, materials andsystemsused to protect joints and voids in the following locations shall be maintained. The materials andsystemsshall be securely attached to or bonded to the adjacent construction, without openings visible through the construction.

1. Joints in or betweenfire-resistance-ratedwalls, floors or floor/ceiling assemblies and roof or roof/ceiling assemblies.
2. Joints insmoke barriers.
3. Voids at the intersection of a horizontal floor assembly and an exterior curtain wall.
4. Voids at the intersection of a horizontalsmoke barrierand an exterior curtain wall.
5. Voids at the intersection of a nonfire-resistance-rated floor assembly and an exterior curtain wall.
6. Voids at the intersection of a verticalfire barrierand an exterior curtain wall.
7. Voids at the intersection of a verticalfire barrierand a nonfire-resistance-rated roof assembly.

Unprotected joints and voids do not need to be protected where such joints and voids were not required to be protected when the building was originally constructed.

Exception:Periodic testing and inspection in accordance
with NFPA 80 and NFPA 105 is not required for swingingfire doorand smoke door assemblies. Swingingfire doorand smoke door assemblies shall be maintained in an operable
condition in accordance with NFPA 80 and NFPA105. Damaged or defective swingingfire doorand smoke
door assemblies shall be repaired or replaced.

Exception:Periodic testing and inspection in accordance
with NFPA 80 and NFPA 105 is not required for swingingfire doorand smoke door assemblies. Swingingfire doorand smoke door assemblies shall be maintained in an operable
condition in accordance with NFPA 80 and NFPA105. Damaged or defective swingingfire doorand smoke
door assemblies shall be repaired or replaced.

Where required by thefire code official, a sign shall be permanently displayed on or near eachfire doorin letters not less than 1 inch (25 mm) high to read as follows:

1. For doors designed to be kept normally open:FIRE DOOR—DO NOT BLOCK.
2. For doors designed to be kept normally closed:FIRE DOOR—KEEP CLOSED.

Exception:Whenapprovedby thefire code official, periodic
testing and inspection in accordance with NFPA 80
and NFPA 105 is not required for inaccessiblefire dampers,
inaccessiblesmoke dampers, and inaccessible combination
fire andsmoke dampers. Inaccessiblefire dampers,
inaccessiblesmoke dampers, and inaccessible combination
fire andsmoke dampersshall be maintained in accordance
with NFPA 80 and NFPA 105 and repaired or
replaced where damaged or defective.

Exception:Whenapprovedby thefire code official, periodic
testing and inspection in accordance with NFPA 80
and NFPA 105 is not required for inaccessiblefire dampers,
inaccessiblesmoke dampers, and inaccessible combination
fire andsmoke dampers. Inaccessiblefire dampers,
inaccessiblesmoke dampers, and inaccessible combination
fire andsmoke dampersshall be maintained in accordance
with NFPA 80 and NFPA 105 and repaired or
replaced where damaged or defective.
