The following terms further defineexplosivesunder the current system applied by DOTn for allexplosive materialsdefined as hazard Class 1 materials. Compatibility group letters are used in concert with the division to specify further limitations on each division noted (for example, the letter G identifies the material as a pyrotechnic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic substance and similar materials).

Division 1.1.Explosivesthat have a massexplosionhazard. A massexplosionis one which affects almost the entire load instantaneously.

Division 1.2.Explosivesthat have a projection hazard but not a massexplosionhazard.

Division 1.3.Explosivesthat have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a massexplosionhazard.

Division 1.4.Explosivesthat pose a minorexplosionhazard. Theexplosiveeffects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not cause virtually instantaneousexplosionof almost the entire contents of the package.

Division 1.5.Very insensitiveexplosives. This division is comprised of substances that have a massexplosionhazard but which are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning todetonationunder normal conditions of transport.

Division 1.6.Extremely insensitive articles which do not have a massexplosionhazard. This division is comprised of articles that contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances and which demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation.
