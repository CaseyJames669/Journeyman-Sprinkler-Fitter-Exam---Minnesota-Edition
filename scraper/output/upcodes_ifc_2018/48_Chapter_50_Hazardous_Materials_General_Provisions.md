# Chapter 50 Hazardous Materials—General Provisions

About this chapter:Chapter 50 contains the general requirements for allhazardous materialsin all occupancies.Hazardous materialsare defined as those that pose an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of operating or emergency personnel, the public and the environment if not properly controlled duringhandling, storage, manufacture, processing, packaging, use, disposal or transportation. The general provisions of this chapter are intended to be companion provisions with the specific requirements of Chapters51through67regarding a given hazardous material. Also, Sections414and415of theInternational Building Code®contain construction requirements related to the storage and use of such materials.

Prevention, control and mitigation of dangerous conditions related to storage,dispensing, use andhandlingofhazardous materialsshall be in accordance with this chapter.

This chapter shall apply to allhazardous materials, including those materials regulated elsewhere in this code, except that where specific requirements are provided in other chapters, those specific requirements shall apply in accordance with the applicable chapter. Where a material has multiple hazards, all hazards shall be addressed.
