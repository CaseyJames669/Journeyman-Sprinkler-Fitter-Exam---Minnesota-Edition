Where capacitors release flammable gases during normal operating conditions,ventilationof rooms containingcapacitor energy storage systemsshall be provided in accordance with theInternational Mechanical Codeand one of the following:

1. Theventilationsystemshall be designed to limit the maximum concentration offlammable gasto 25 percent of the lower flammability limit.
2. Continuousventilationshall be provided at a rate of not less than 1 cubic foot per minute (cfm) per square foot [0.00508 m3/(s • m2)] of floor area, but not less than 150 cfm (4 m3/min).

The exhaustsystemshall be designed to provide air movement across all parts of the floor for gases having a vapor density greater than air and across all parts of the ceiling for gases having a vapor density less than air.

Where capacitors containliquidelectrolyte,approvedmethods and materials shall be provided for the control and neutralization of spills of electrolyte or otherhazardous materialsin areas containing capacitors as follows:

1. For capacitors with free-flowing electrolyte, the method and materials shall be capable of neutralizing a spill of the total capacity from the largest cell or block to a pH between 5.0 and 9.0.
2. For capacitors with immobilized electrolyte, the method and material shall be capable of neutralizing a spill of 3.0 percent of the capacity of the largest cell or block in the room to a pH between 5.0 and 9.0.
