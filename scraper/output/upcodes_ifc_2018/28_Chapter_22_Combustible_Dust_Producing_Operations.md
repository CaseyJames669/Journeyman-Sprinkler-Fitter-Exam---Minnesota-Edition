# Chapter 22 Combustible Dust-Producing Operations

About this chapter:Chapter 22 provides requirements that seek to reduce the likelihood of dustexplosionsby managing the hazards of ignitable suspensions ofcombustible dustsassociated with a variety of operations including woodworking, mining, food processing, agriculturalcommoditystorage andhandlingand pharmaceutical manufacturing, among others. Ignition source control and good housekeeping practices in occupancies containing dust-producing operations are emphasized. Appropriate standards are referenced to deal with the specific dust hazards.

Permitsshall be required forcombustible dust-producing operations as set forth inSection 105.6.

The following term is defined inChapter 2:

The requirements of NFPA 652 apply to all new andexistingfacilitiesand operations withcombustible dusthazard.Existingfacilitiesshall have a dust hazard analysis (DHA) completed in accordance with Section 7.1.2 of NFPA 652.

Thefire code officialshall be authorized to order a dust hazard analysis to occur sooner if acombustible dusthazard has been identified in afacilitythat has not previously performed an analysis.

The industry- orcommodity-specific codes and standards listed inTable2204.1 shall be complied with based on the identification and evaluation of the specific fire anddeflagrationhazards that exist at afacility.
