# Chapter 35 Welding and Other Hot Work

About this chapter:Chapter 35 covers requirements for safety in welding and other types ofhot workby reducing the potential for fire ignitions that usually result in large losses. Several different types ofhot workwould fall under the requirements found in Chapter 35, including both gas and electric arc methods and any open-torch operations. Many of the activities of this chapter focus on the actions of the occupants.

Hot workshall only be conducted in areas designed or authorized for that purpose by the personnel responsible for ahot work program.Hot workshall not be conducted in the following areas unless approval has been obtained from thefire code official:

1. Areas where the sprinklersystemis impaired.
2. Areas where there exists the potential of anexplosiveatmosphere, such as locations where flammable gases,liquidsor vapors are present.
3. Areas with readily ignitable materials, such as storage of large quantities of bulk sulfur, baled paper,cotton, lint, dust or loose combustible materials.
4. On board ships at dock or ships under construction or repair.
5. At other locations as specified by thefire code official.

An oxygen-fuel gassystemwith two or more manifoldedcylindersof oxygen shall be in accordance with NFPA 51.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

Visible hazard identification signs shall be provided where required byChapter 50. Where thehot workareais open to persons other than the operator of thehot work equipment, conspicuous signs shall be posted to warn others before they enter thehot work area. Such signs shall display the following warning:

CAUTIONHOT WORKIN PROGRESSSTAY CLEAR

Afire watchshall be provided duringhot workactivities and shall continue for not less than 30 minutes after the conclusion of the work. Thefire code official, or the responsible manager under ahot work program, is authorized to extend thefire watchbased on the hazards or work being performed.

Exception:Where thehot work areahas no fire hazards or combustible exposures.

A pre-hot-workcheck shall be conducted prior to work to ensure that all equipment is safe and hazards are recognized and protected. A report of the check shall be kept at the worksiteduring the work and available upon request. The pre-hot-workcheck shall determine all of the following:

1. Hot work equipmentto be used shall be in satisfactory operating condition and in good repair.
2. Hot worksiteis clear of combustibles or combustibles are protected.
3. Exposed construction is of noncombustible materials or, if combustible, then protected.
4. Openings are protected.
5. Floors are kept clean.
6. Exposed combustibles are not located on the opposite side of partitions, walls, ceilings or floors.
7. Fire watches, where required, are assigned.
8. Approvedactions have been taken to prevent accidental activation of suppression and detection equipment in accordance with Sections3504.1.8and3504.1.9.
9. Fire extinguishers and fire hoses (where provided) are operable and available.

The storage or use of a singlecylinderof oxygen and a singlecylinderof fuel gas located on a cart shall be allowed without requiring thecylindersto be separated in accordance withSection 5003.9.8or5003.10.3.6when thecylindersare connected to regulators, ready for service, equipped with apparatus designed for cutting or welding and all of the following:

1. Carts shall be kept away from the cutting or welding operation in accordance withSection 3505.5or fire-resistant shields shall be provided.
2. Cylindersshall be secured to the cart to resist movement.
3. Carts shall be in accordance withSection 5003.10.3.
4. Cylindervalves not having fixed hand wheels shall have keys, handles or nonadjustable wrenches on valve stems while thecylindersare in service.
5. Cylindervalve outlet connections shall conform to the requirements of CGA V-1.
6. Cylindervalves shall be closed when work is finished.
7. Cylindervalves shall be closed before moving the cart.

Signage shall be provided for piping and hosesystemsas follows:

1. Above-ground pipingsystemsshall be marked in accordance with ASME A13.1.
2. Station outlets shall be marked to indicate their intended usage.
3. Signs shall be posted, indicating clearly the location and identity of section shutoff valves.

Signs shall be posted for oxygen manifolds with service pressures not exceeding 200 psig (1379 kPa). Such signs shall include the words:

LOW-PRESSURE MANIFOLDDO NOT CONNECT HIGH-PRESSURECYLINDERSMAXIMUM PRESSURE 250 PSIG

The following steps shall be taken to minimize hazards wherehot workmust be performed on a flammable orcombustible liquidstoragecontainer:

1. Use alternative methods to avoidhot workwhere possible.
2. Analyze the hazards prior to performinghot work, identify the potential hazards and the methods of hazard control.
3. Hot workshall conform to the requirements of the code or standard to which thecontainerwas originally fabricated.
4. Test the immediate and surrounding work area with acombustible gas detectorand provide for a means of continuing monitoring while conducting thehot work.
5. Qualified employees and contractors performinghot workshall use an industry-approvedhot workpermitsystemto control the work.
6. Personnel shall be properly trained onhot workpolicies and procedures regarding equipment, safety, hazard controls and job-specific requirements.
7. On-sitesafety supervision shall be present wherehot workis in progress to protect the personnel conducting thehot workand provide additional overview ofsite-specific hazards.
