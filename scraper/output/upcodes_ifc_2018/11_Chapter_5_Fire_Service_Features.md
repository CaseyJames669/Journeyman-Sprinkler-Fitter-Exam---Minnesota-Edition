# Chapter 5 Fire Service Features

About this chapter:Chapter 5 provides requirements that apply to all buildings and occupancies and pertainto accessroads,access tobuilding openings and roofs, premises identification,key boxes, fire protection water supplies,fire command centers, fire departmentaccess toequipment and emergency responder radio coverage in buildings. Although many safety features are part of the building design, features such as proper fire departmentaccessroads and radio coverage are necessary in case of emergency and are importanttoolsfor emergency responders for public safety and their own safety.
