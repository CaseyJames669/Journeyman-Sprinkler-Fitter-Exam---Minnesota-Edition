# Chapter 33 Fire Safety During Construction and Demolition

About this chapter:Chapter 33 outlines general fire safety precautions for all structures and all occupancies during construction and demolition operations. In general, these requirements seek to maintain required levels of fire protection, limit fire spread, establish the appropriate operation of equipment and promote prompt response to fire emergencies. Features regulated includefire protection systems, fire fighteraccess tothesiteand building,means of egress,hazardous materials storageand use, and temporary heating equipment and other ignition sources.Fire watchesare an important component of this chapter.
