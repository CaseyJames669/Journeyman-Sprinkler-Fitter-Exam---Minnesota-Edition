# Chapter 39 Processing and Extraction Facilities

About this chapter:Chapter 39 is a new chapter focused on the processing and extraction of oils and fats from various plants. This process includes extraction byuseof a solvent,desolventizingthe raw material, production of themiscella, distillation of the solvent from themiscellaand solvent recovery. The processes used are not necessarily typical hazardous material processes, and often thesystemsand equipment associated with such processes are not listed. Because of the typical lack of listings, thesystemsand equipment need specific approvals for each installation. This chapter provides thetoolsto appropriately address the hazards while also meeting the unique needs of industry. This chapter has provisions for a technical report prepared by aregistered design professionaland requiressiteinspections to make sure equipment andsystemsare installed as designed andapproved.

Permitsshall be required as set forth in Sections105.6and105.7.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

The use of flammable andcombustible liquidsforliquidextraction processes where theliquidis boiled, distilled or evaporated shall be located within a hazardous exhaust fumehood, rated for exhausting flammable vapors. Electrical equipment used within the hazardous exhaust fumehoodshall be rated for use in flammable atmospheres. Heating of flammable orcombustible liquidsover an open flame is prohibited.

Exception:The use of a heating element not rated for flammable atmospheres, where documentation from the manufacture, orapprovedtesting laboratory indicates the element is rated for heating offlammable liquids.

The technical report shall contain all of the following:

Manufacturer information.Preparer of record of the technical report.Date of review and report revision history.Signature page, including all of the following:Author of the report.Date of report.Date and signature ofregistered design professionalof record performing the design or peer review.Model number of the item evaluated. If the equipment is provided with a serial number, the serial number shall be included for verification at the time ofsiteinspection.Methodology of the design or peer review process used to determine minimum safety requirements. Methodology shall consider the basis of design, and shall include a code analysis and code path to demonstrate whether specific codes or standards are applicable.Equipment description. A list of every component and subassembly, such as fittings, hose, quick disconnects, gauges,siteglass, gaskets, valves, pumps,vessels,containersand switches, of thesystemor equipment, indicating the manufacturer, model number, material and solvent compatibility. Manufacturer's data sheets shall be provided.A general flow schematic or general process flow diagram of the process. Post-processing or winterization shall be included in this diagram. Primary components of the process equipment shall be identified and match the equipment list required in Item 7. Operating temperatures, pressures and solvent state of matter shall be identified in each primary step or component. A piping and instrumentation diagram (PID or P&ID) shall be provided.Analysis of thevessel(s) if pressurized beyond standard atmospheric pressure. Analysis shall include purchased and fabricated components.Structural analysis for the framesystemsupporting the equipment.Process safety analysis of the extractionsystem, from the introduction ofraw productto the end of the extraction process.Comprehensive process hazard analysis considering failure modes and points of failure throughout the process. The process hazard analysis shall include a review of emergency procedure information provided by the manufacturer of the equipment or process and not that of thefacility, building or room.Review of the assembly instructions, operational and maintenance manuals provided by the manufacturer.List of references used in the analysis.
