# Chapter 28 Lumber Yards and Agro-Industrial, Solid Biomass and Woodworking Facilities

About this chapter:Chapter 28 provides requirements that are intended to prevent fires andexplosions, facilitate fire control and reduce exposures to and fromfacilitiesstoring, selling or processing wood and forest products, including sawdust, wood chips, shavings, bark mulch, shorts, finished planks, sheets, posts, poles, timber and raw logs and the hazard they represent once ignited. Also included aresolid biomass feedstockandraw productsassociated withagro-industrialfacilitiesand the outdoor storage of pallets at pallet manufacturing and recyclingfacilities. This chapter requires active and passive fire protection features to reduce on- and off-siteexposures, limit fire size and development and facilitate fire fighting by employees and the fire service.
