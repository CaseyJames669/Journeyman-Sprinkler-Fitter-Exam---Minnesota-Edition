# Chapter 63 Oxidizers, Oxidizing Gases and Oxidizing Cryogenic Fluids

About this chapter:Chapter 63 addresses the hazards associated withsolid,liquid, gaseous andcryogenic fluidoxidizing materials, including oxygen in homeuse, and establishes criteria for their safe storage and protection inindoorand outdoor storagefacilities, minimizing the potential for uncontrolled releases and contact with fuel sources. Althoughoxidizersthemselves do not burn, they pose unique fire hazards because of their ability to support combustion by breaking down and giving off oxygen.
