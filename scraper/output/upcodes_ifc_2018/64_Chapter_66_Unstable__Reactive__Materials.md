# Chapter 66 Unstable (Reactive) Materials

About this chapter:Chapter 66 addresses the hazards of unstable (reactive)liquidandsolidmaterials as well as unstable (reactive) compressed gases. In addition to their unstable reactivity, these materials may pose other hazards, such as toxicity, corrosivity, explosivity, flammability or oxidizing potential. This chapter, however, is intended to address those materials whose primary hazard is unstable reactivity. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of the code with respect to all hazards. Strict compliance with the provisions of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping andstoragearrangements, helps to reduce the exposure hazards associated with unstable (reactive) materials in a fire or other emergency.

The storage and use of unstable (reactive) materials shall be in accordance with this chapter.Compressed gasesshall also comply withChapter 53.

Exceptions:Display and storage inGroup Mand storage inGroup Soccupancies complying withSection 5003.11.Detonable unstable (reactive) materials shall be stored in accordance withChapter 56.

1. Display and storage inGroup Mand storage inGroup Soccupancies complying withSection 5003.11.
2. Detonable unstable (reactive) materials shall be stored in accordance withChapter 56.
