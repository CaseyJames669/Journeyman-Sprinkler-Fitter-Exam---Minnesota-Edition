# Chapter 59 Flammable Solids

About this chapter:Chapter 59 addresses general requirements forstorageandhandlingofflammable solids, especiallymagnesium; however, it is important to note that several othersolidmaterials, including such metals as titanium, zirconium, hafnium, calcium, zinc, sodium, lithium, potassium, sodium/potassium alloys, uranium, thorium and plutonium, can beexplosionhazards under the right conditions. Some of these metals are almost exclusively laboratory materials but because of where they are used, fire service personnel must be trained to handle emergency situations. Because uranium, thorium and plutonium are also radioactive materials, they pose more specialized problems for fire service personnel.

Permitsshall be required as set forth inSection 105.6.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

Each machine shall be equipped with an individual dust-separating unit.

Exceptions:One separator is allowed to serve two dust-producing units on multiunit machines.One separator is allowed to serve not more than four portable dust-producing units in a single enclosure or stand.

1. One separator is allowed to serve two dust-producing units on multiunit machines.
2. One separator is allowed to serve not more than four portable dust-producing units in a single enclosure or stand.

Fire-extinguishing materials shall be provided for every operator performing machining, grinding or other processing operation onmagnesiumin accordance with either of the folowing:

1. Within 30 feet (9144 mm), a supply of extinguishing materials in anapprovedcontainerwith a hand scoop or shovel for applying the material.
2. Within 75 feet (22 860 mm), a portable fire extinguisher complying withSection 906.

All extinguishing materials shall beapprovedfor use onmagnesiumfires. Where extinguishing materials are stored in cabinets or other enclosed areas, the enclosures shall be openable without the use of a key or special knowledge.
