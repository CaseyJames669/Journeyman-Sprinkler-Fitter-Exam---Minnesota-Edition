# Chapter 21 Dry Cleaning

About this chapter:Chapter 21 provides provisions that are intended to reduce hazards associated with use of flammable and combustibledry cleaningsolvents. These materials, like all volatile organicchemicals, generate significant quantities of static electricity and are thus readily ignitable. Many flammable and nonflammabledry cleaningsolvents also possesshealth hazardswhen involved in a fire.

Permitsshall be required as set forth inSection 105.6.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

SOLVENT OR LIQUID CLASSIFICATIONS.

- Class I solvents.
- Class II solvents.
- Class IIIA solvents.
- Class IIIB solvents.
- Class IV solvents.

Dry cleaningsolvents shall be classified according to theirflash pointsas follows:

1. Class I solvents areliquidshaving aflash pointbelow 100°F (38°C).
2. Class II solvents areliquidshaving aflash pointat or above 100°F (38°C) and below 140°F (60°C).
3. Class IIIA solvents areliquidshaving aflash pointat or above 140°F (60°C) and below 200°F (93°C).
4. Class IIIB solvents areliquidshaving aflash pointat or above 200°F (93°C).
5. Class IV solvents areliquidsclassified as nonflammable.

Dry cleaning plantsandsystemsshall be classified based on the solvents used as follows:

1. Type I—systemsusing Class I solvents.
2. Type II—systemsusing Class II solvents.
3. Type III-A—systemsusing Class IIIA solvents.
4. Type III-B—systemsusing Class IIIB solvents.
5. Type IV—systemsusing Class IV solvents in whichdry cleaningis not conducted by the public.
6. Type V—systemsusing Class IV solvents in whichdry cleaningis conducted by the public.

Spotting and pretreating operations conducted in accordance withSection 2106shall not change the type of thedry cleaning plant.

Type IV and Vdry cleaning systemsshall be provided with an automatically activated exhaustventilationsystemto maintain an air velocity of not less than 100 feet per minute (0.51 m/s) through the loading door when the door is opened. Suchsystemsfordry cleaningequipment shall comply with theInternational Mechanical Code.

Exception:Dry cleaningunits are not required to be provided with exhaustventilationwhere an exhausthoodis installed immediately outside of and above the loading door and operates at an airflow rate as follows:

| Q | = | flow rate exhausted through thehood, cubic feet per minute (m3/s). |
| ALD | = | area of the loading door, square feet (m2). |

Whereapproved, articles that cannot be washed in the usual washing machines are allowed to be cleaned in scrubbing tubs. Scrubbing tubs shall comply with the following:

1. Only Class II or IIIliquidsshall be used.
2. The total amount of solvent used in such opencontainersshall not exceed 3 gallons (11 L).
3. Scrubbing tubs shall be secured to the floor.
4. Scrubbing tubs shall be provided with permanent 11/2-inch (38 mm) drains. Such drain shall be provided with a trap and shall be connected to anapprovedcontainer.

Type IIdry cleaningand solventtankstorage rooms shall not be located below grade or above the lowest floor level of the building and shall comply with Sections2107.2.1through2107.2.3.

Exception:Solvent storagetanksinstalled underground, in vaults or in special enclosures in accordance withChapter 57.

Solvent storagetanksfor Class II, IIIA and IIIBliquidsshall conform to the requirements of Chapter 57 and be located underground or outside, above ground.

Exception:As provided in NFPA 32 for inside storage or treatmenttanks.

Anautomatic sprinkler systemshall be installed in accordance withSection 903.3.1.1throughoutdry cleaning plantscontaining TypeII, TypeIII-A or Type III-Bdry cleaning systems.
