# Chapter 4 Emergency Planning and Preparedness

About this chapter:Chapter 4 addresses the human contribution to life safety in buildings when a fire or other emergency occurs. The requirements for continuous training and scheduled fire, evacuation andlockdowndrills can be as important as the required periodic inspections and maintenance of built-in fire protection features. The level of preparation by the occupants also improves the emergency responders' abilities during an emergency. TheInternational Building Code®focuses on built-in fire protection features, such asautomatic sprinkler systems,fire-resistance-rated construction and properly designed egresssystems, whereas this chapter fully addresses the human element.

Reporting of emergencies, coordination with emergency response forces, emergency plans and procedures for managing or responding to emergencies shall comply with the provisions of this section.

Exception:Firms that haveapprovedon-premises fire-fighting organizations and that are in compliance withapprovedprocedures for fire reporting.

Section 401.7 is deleted to allow schools and other occupancies to count an unplanned evacuation toward the total number of required evacuation drills, provided proper records are completed and maintained. Unplanned evacuations can often identify unknown deficiencies or weaknesses within afacility's emergency plan.
