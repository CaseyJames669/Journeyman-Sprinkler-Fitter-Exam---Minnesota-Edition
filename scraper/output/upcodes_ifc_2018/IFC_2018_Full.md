# Chapter 4 Emergency Planning and Preparedness

About this chapter:Chapter 4 addresses the human contribution to life safety in buildings when a fire or other emergency occurs. The requirements for continuous training and scheduled fire, evacuation andlockdowndrills can be as important as the required periodic inspections and maintenance of built-in fire protection features. The level of preparation by the occupants also improves the emergency responders' abilities during an emergency. TheInternational Building Code®focuses on built-in fire protection features, such asautomatic sprinkler systems,fire-resistance-rated construction and properly designed egresssystems, whereas this chapter fully addresses the human element.

Reporting of emergencies, coordination with emergency response forces, emergency plans and procedures for managing or responding to emergencies shall comply with the provisions of this section.

# Chapter 9 Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems

About this chapter:Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active fire protection equipmentsystemsto perform the functions of detecting a fire, alerting the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency, mass notification, gas detection, controlling smoke and controlling or extinguishing the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, theheightand theareaof the building, because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of theInternational Building Code®;however, this chapter also contains periodic testing criteria that are not contained in theInternational Building Code.In addition, the specialfire protection systemrequirements based on use and occupancy found inChapter 4of theInternational Building Codeare duplicated in this chapter as a user convenience.

# Chapter 10 Means of Egress

About this chapter:Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing themeans of egressestablished as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exitingsystemfor all occupancies. This chapter addresses all portions of the egresssystem(exit access,exitsandexit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection ofmeans of egresscomponents. Functional and operational characteristics that willpermitthe safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified.

Themeans of egressprotection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (seeChapter 7),interior finish(seeChapter 8), fire suppression and detectionsystems(seeChapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Sections1003through1030are duplicated text from Chapter 10 of theInternational Building Code®; however, theInternational Fire Code®contains an additionalSection 1031on maintenance of themeans of egresssysteminexistingbuildings. Retroactive minimummeans of egressrequirements forexistingbuildings are found inChapter 11.

It shall be unlawful to alter a building or structure in a manner that will reduce the number ofexitsor the capacity of themeans of egressto less than required by this code.

Younger children are required to be located as close to
ground level (i.e., firststory) as possible to minimize the
number of steps that need to be traveled toexitthe building.Roomsused by these younger children are allowed to
be above or below the firststoryif other egress and/or fire
protection features are provided. See Minnesota Statutes,

# Chapter 38 Higher Education Laboratories

About this chapter:Chapter 38 is a new chapter addressing the unique needs of laboratories in higher education institutions. These academic institutions often have chemistry, biology, medical, engineering and other laboratories wherehazardous materialsare used. This chapter addresses both new andexistingbuildings and new andexistinglaboratories. Applying the general hazardous material provisions has been difficult because of the way these laboratories operate. Often there are many small laboratories with very small quantities ofhazardous materialsthat individually do not exceed the maximum allowable quantities (MAQs). In aggregate, the quantities will exceed the MAQs and could result in the need for aGroup Hoccupancy classification. However, it is believed that the lower density ofhazardous materialsoften mitigates the overall risk. Therefore, this lower density along with a package of additional requirements, including the concept oflaboratory suites, are appropriate to allow the laboratories to not be classified asGroup H. This chapter also addresses the use of certain materials typically prohibited forexistingbuildings not protected throughout with a sprinklersystem. These allowances come with certain safety measures such as the use of storage cabinets and fumehoods. Note thatSection 428of theInternational Building Code®addresses the construction requirements found in this chapter forlaboratory suites.

The provisions of this chapter shall be applied as exceptions or additions to applicable requirements of this code. Unless specifically modified by this chapter, thestorage, use andhandlingofhazardous materialsshall comply with the provisions in Chapters50through67and theInternational Building Codefor quantities not exceeding the maximum allowable quantity.

# Chapter 51 Aerosols

About this chapter:Chapter 51 provides requirements for the prevention, control and extinguishment of fires andexplosionsinfacilitieswhere retailaerosol productsare displayed or stored. It is concerned with both life safety and property protection from a fire; however, historically,aerosol productfires have caused property loss more frequently than loss of life. Requirements for storingaerosol productsare dependent on the level ofaerosol product, level of sprinkler protection, type of storage condition and quantity ofaerosol products.

# Chapter 57 Flammable and Combustible Liquids

About this chapter:Chapter 57 provides requirements that are intended to reduce the likelihood of fires involving the storage,handling, use or transportation of flammable andcombustible liquids. Adherence to these practices may also limit damage in the event of an accidental fire involving these materials. Theseliquidsare used for fuel, lubricants, cleaners, solvents, medicine and even drinking. The danger associated with flammable andcombustible liquidsis that the vapors from theseliquids, when combined with air in their flammable range, will burn or explode at temperatures near normal living and working environments.

1. All in-building coveragesystemcomponents shall be contained in a National Electrical Manufacturer's Association (NEMA) 4-type waterproof cabinet.
2. Batterysystemsused for the emergency power source shall be contained in a NEMA 4-type waterproof cabinet.
3. The in-building coveragesystemandbattery systemshall be electrically supervised and monitored by asupervisory service, or whenapprovedby thefire code official, shall sound an audible signal at aconstantly attended location.
4. Equipment shall have FCC certification prior to installation.

1. Certification of in-buildingsystemtraining issued by a nationally recognized organization or school.
2. A certificate issued by the manufacturer of the equipment being installed.

These qualifications shall not be required where demonstration of adequate skills and experience satisfactory to thefire code officialis provided.

1. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of 20 approximately equal test areas.
2. The test shall be conducted using a calibrated handheld or hip-worn device of the latest brand and model used by theagencytalking through theagency's radio communicationssystem.
3. Failure of a maximum of two nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test.
4. In the event that three of the test areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor shall be permitted to be divided into 40 equal test areas. Failure of a maximum of four nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test. If thesystemfails the 40-area test, thesystemshall be altered to meet the 95 percent coverage requirement.
5. A test location approximately in the center of each test area shall be selected for the test, with the radio enabled to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the building through the publicagency's radio communicationssystem. Once the test location has been selected, that location shall represent the entire test area. Failure in the selected test location shall be considered failure of that test area. Additional test locations shall not be permitted.
6. The gain values of all amplifiers, if applicable, shall be measured, and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the buildingownerso that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the buildingownershall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.
7. As part of the installation, a spectrum analyzer or other suitable test equipment shall be utilized to ensure spurious oscillations are not being generated by the subject in-building coveragesystem. This test shall be conducted at time of installation and subsequent annual inspections.
8. A test shall be considered a "failure" when a transmission from the test device within the building fails to deliver intelligible audio or data to the appropriate public safety dispatch center or equivalent as would be expected during normal operation; and/or when a transmission from a public safety dispatch center or equivalent fails to deliver intelligible audio or data to the test device within the building as would be expected during normal operation.

(Note:Section P105.4 does not exist due to a numbering error in the MN Rule.)

1. In-building coverage test as described inSection P105.3.
2. Signal boosters in-building coveragesystemsshall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance.
3. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If, within the one-hour test period, the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined.
4. All other active components shall be checked to verify operation within the manufacturer's specifications.
5. At the conclusion of the testing, a report, which shall verify compliance withSection P105.3, shall be submitted to thefire code official.
