# Chapter 3 Construction

| TIERED SEATING ELEMENT | LOAD TYPE | LOAD |
| Seats (vertical) | L | 120 pounds per linear foot. |
| Treads | L | Stairtreads and steppedaisletreads shall be designed to resist a minimum concentrated load of 300 pounds on an area of 4 square inches. |
| Handrailsandguards, uniform load | Rr | Handrailassemblies andguardsshall be designed to resist a load of 50 pounds per linear foot (pound per foot) applied in any point at the top. The supporting elements shall transfer this load to the structure. |
| Handrailsandguards, concentrated load | Rr | Handrailassemblies andguardsshall be able to resist a single concentrated load of 200 pounds, applied in any direction at any direction along the top. Attachment devices and supporting elements shall transfer this load to the structure. |
| Guards, infill components | Rr | Intermediate rails (all those except thehandrail), balusters, and panel fillers (including flexible infill components) shall be designed to withstand a horizontally applied normal load of 50 pounds on an area equal to 1 square foot, including openings and space between rails. Application of the loads shall not allowguardopenings greater than that permitted by Sections408.2and503.2. |
