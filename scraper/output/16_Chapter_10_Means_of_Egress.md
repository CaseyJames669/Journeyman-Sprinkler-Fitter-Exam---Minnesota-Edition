# Chapter 10 Means of Egress

About this chapter:Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing themeans of egressestablished as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exitingsystemfor all occupancies. This chapter addresses all portions of the egresssystem(exit access,exitsandexit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection ofmeans of egresscomponents. Functional and operational characteristics that willpermitthe safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified.

Themeans of egressprotection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (seeChapter 7),interior finish(seeChapter 8), fire suppression and detectionsystems(seeChapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Sections1003through1030are duplicated text from Chapter 10 of theInternational Building Code®; however, theInternational Fire Code®contains an additionalSection 1031on maintenance of themeans of egresssysteminexistingbuildings. Retroactive minimummeans of egressrequirements forexistingbuildings are found inChapter 11.

It shall be unlawful to alter a building or structure in a manner that will reduce the number ofexitsor the capacity of themeans of egressto less than required by this code.

Younger children are required to be located as close to
ground level (i.e., firststory) as possible to minimize the
number of steps that need to be traveled toexitthe building.Roomsused by these younger children are allowed to
be above or below the firststoryif other egress and/or fire
protection features are provided. See Minnesota Statutes,
section 123B.51, subdivision7.
