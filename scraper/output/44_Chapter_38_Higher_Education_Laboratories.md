# Chapter 38 Higher Education Laboratories

About this chapter:Chapter 38 is a new chapter addressing the unique needs of laboratories in higher education institutions. These academic institutions often have chemistry, biology, medical, engineering and other laboratories wherehazardous materialsare used. This chapter addresses both new andexistingbuildings and new andexistinglaboratories. Applying the general hazardous material provisions has been difficult because of the way these laboratories operate. Often there are many small laboratories with very small quantities ofhazardous materialsthat individually do not exceed the maximum allowable quantities (MAQs). In aggregate, the quantities will exceed the MAQs and could result in the need for aGroup Hoccupancy classification. However, it is believed that the lower density ofhazardous materialsoften mitigates the overall risk. Therefore, this lower density along with a package of additional requirements, including the concept oflaboratory suites, are appropriate to allow the laboratories to not be classified asGroup H. This chapter also addresses the use of certain materials typically prohibited forexistingbuildings not protected throughout with a sprinklersystem. These allowances come with certain safety measures such as the use of storage cabinets and fumehoods. Note thatSection 428of theInternational Building Code®addresses the construction requirements found in this chapter forlaboratory suites.

The provisions of this chapter shall be applied as exceptions or additions to applicable requirements of this code. Unless specifically modified by this chapter, thestorage, use andhandlingofhazardous materialsshall comply with the provisions in Chapters50through67and theInternational Building Codefor quantities not exceeding the maximum allowable quantity.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

HIGHER EDUCATION LABORATORY.

The maximumcontainersize for allhazardous materialsshall be 5.3 gallons (20 L) forliquids, 50 pounds (22.7 kg) forsolids, 100 cubic feet (2.83 m3) forhealth-hazardgases perTable 5003.1.1(2)and 500 cubic feet (14.15 m3) for all other gases in accordance withTable 5003.1.1(1).

Exception:Hazardous waste collectioncontainers, for other than Class Iflammable liquidsand Class IIcombustible liquids, are permitted to exceed 5.3 gallons (20 L) whereapproved.

Quantities of Class Iflammable liquidsin storage anduseshall not exceed 8 gallons (30 L) per 100 square feet (9.29 m2) of floor area. Densities shall be reduced by 25 percent on the 4th through 6th floors of the building, and by 50 percent above the 6th floor. Regardless of the density, themaximum allowable quantity per control areaorlaboratory suitein accordance with this chapter, shall not be exceeded.

Exception:Designated hazardous waste collection areas or rooms within alaboratory suiteorcontrol areaare not limited, but such materials shall not exceed the maximum allowable quantity perlaboratory suiteorcontrol area.

The number oflaboratory suitesand percentage of maximum allowable quantities ofhazardous materialsinlaboratory suitesshall be in accordance withTable3804.1.1.
