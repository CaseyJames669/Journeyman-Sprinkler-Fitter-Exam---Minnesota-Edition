# Chapter 51 Aerosols

About this chapter:Chapter 51 provides requirements for the prevention, control and extinguishment of fires andexplosionsinfacilitieswhere retailaerosol productsare displayed or stored. It is concerned with both life safety and property protection from a fire; however, historically,aerosol productfires have caused property loss more frequently than loss of life. Requirements for storingaerosol productsare dependent on the level ofaerosol product, level of sprinkler protection, type of storage condition and quantity ofaerosol products.

Metalaerosol containersshall be limited to a maximum size of 33.8 fluid ounces (1000 ml). Plasticaerosol containersshall be limited to a maximum 4 fluid ounces (118 ml) except as provided inSection 5104.1.1. Glassaerosol containersshall be limited to a maximum 4 fluid ounces (118 ml).

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

- Level 1 aerosol products.
- Level 2 aerosol products.
- Level 3 aerosol products.

Aerosol productsshall be classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 in accordance withTable5103.1 and NFPA 30B.Aerosol productsincartonsthat are not identified in accordance with this section shall be classified as Level3.
