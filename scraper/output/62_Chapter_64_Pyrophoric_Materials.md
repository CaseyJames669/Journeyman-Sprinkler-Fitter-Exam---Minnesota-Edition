# Chapter 64 Pyrophoric Materials

About this chapter:Chapter 64 regulates the hazards associated withpyrophoricmaterials, which are capable of spontaneously igniting in the air at or below a temperature of 130°F (54°C). Manypyrophoricmaterials also pose severe flammability or reactivity hazards. This chapter addresses only the hazards associated withpyrophoricmaterials. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of this code with respect to all hazards.

Permitsshall be required as set forth inSection 105.6.

The following term is defined inChapter 2:

Indoorstorage ofpyrophoricmaterials in amounts exceeding themaximum allowable quantity per control areaindicated inTable 5003.1.1(1), shall be in accordance with Sections5001,5003and5004and this chapter.

Thestorageof silane gas, and gas mixtures with a silane concentration of 1.37 percent or more by volume, shall be in accordance with CGA G-13.

Storage ofpyrophoricsolidsandliquidsshall be limited to a maximum area of 100 square feet (9.3 m2) per pile. Storage shall not exceed 5 feet (1524 mm) in height. Individualcontainersshall not be stacked.

Aislesbetween storage piles shall be not less than 10 feet (3048 mm) in width.

Individualtanksorcontainersshall not exceed 500 gallons (1893 L) in capacity.

In addition to the requirements ofSection 5003.9.8,indoorstorage ofpyrophoricmaterials shall be isolated from incompatiblehazardous materialsby 1-hourfire barrierswith openings protected in accordance with theInternational Building Code.

Exception:Storage inapprovedhazardous materials storagecabinets constructed in accordance withSection 5003.8.7.

Outdoor storage ofpyrophoricmaterials in amounts exceeding themaximum allowable quantity per control areaindicated inTable 5003.1.1(3)shall be in accordance with Sections5001,5003and5004, and this chapter.

Thestorageof silane gas, and gas mixtures with a silane concentration of 1.37 percent or more by volume, shall be in accordance with CGA G-13.

The separation ofpyrophoricsolids,liquidsand gases from buildings,lot lines, public streets, public alleys,public waysormeans of egressshall be in accordance with the following:

- Solidsandliquids. Two times the separation required byChapter 57for Class IBflammable liquids.
- Gases. The location and maximum amount ofpyrophoricgas per storage area shall be in accordance withTable6404.2.1.

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 cubic foot = 0.02832 m3.The minimum required distances shall be reduced to 5 feet where protective structures having a minimumfire resistanceof 2 hours interrupt the line of sight between thecontainerand the exposure. The protective structure shall be not less than 5 feet from the exposure. The configuration of the protective structure shall allow naturalventilationto prevent the accumulation of hazardous gas concentrations.
