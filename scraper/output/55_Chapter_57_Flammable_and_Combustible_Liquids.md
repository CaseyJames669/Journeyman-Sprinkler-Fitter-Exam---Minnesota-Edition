# Chapter 57 Flammable and Combustible Liquids

About this chapter:Chapter 57 provides requirements that are intended to reduce the likelihood of fires involving the storage,handling, use or transportation of flammable andcombustible liquids. Adherence to these practices may also limit damage in the event of an accidental fire involving these materials. Theseliquidsare used for fuel, lubricants, cleaners, solvents, medicine and even drinking. The danger associated with flammable andcombustible liquidsis that the vapors from theseliquids, when combined with air in their flammable range, will burn or explode at temperatures near normal living and working environments. The regulations herein are intended to prevent the flammable andcombustible liquidsfrom being ignited and provide mitigating requirements for when a fire does occur.

This chapter shall not apply toliquidsas otherwise provided in other laws or regulations or chapters of this code, including:

- Specific provisions forflammable liquidsin motor fuel-dispensingfacilities,repair garages,airportsandmarinasinChapter 23.
- Medicines, foodstuffs, cosmetics and commercial or institutional products containing not more than 50 percent by volume of water-miscibleliquidsand with the remainder of the solution not being flammable, provided that such materials are packaged in individualcontainersnot exceeding 1.3 gallons (5 L).
- Quantities of alcoholic beverages in retail or wholesale sales or storage occupancies, provided that theliquidsare packaged in individualcontainersnot exceeding 1.3 gallons (5 L).
- Storage and use of fuel oil intanksandcontainersconnected to oil-burning equipment. Such storage and use shall be in accordance withSection 603. For abandonment of fuel oiltanks, this chapter applies.
- Refrigerantliquidsand oils in refrigerationsystems(seeSection 605).
- Storage and display ofaerosol productscomplying with Chapter 51.
- Storageanduseofliquidsthat do not have afire pointwhen tested in accordance with ASTM D92.
- Liquidswith aflash pointgreater than 95°F (35°C) in a water-miscible solution or dispersion with a water and inert (noncombustible)solidscontent of more than 80 percent by weight, which do not sustain combustion.
- Liquidswithoutflash pointsthat can be flammable under some conditions, such as certain halogenated hydrocarbons and mixtures containing halogenated hydrocarbons.
- The storage of distilled spirits and wines in wooden barrels and casks.
- Commercial cooking oilstoragetanksystemslocated within a building and designed and installed in accordance withSection 608and NFPA 30.

Flammable andcombustible liquidsshall be classified in accordance with the definitions inChapter 2.

When mixed with lowerflash-pointliquids, Class II or IIIliquidsare capable of assuming the characteristics of the lowerflash-pointliquids. Under such conditions, the appropriate provisions of this chapter for the actualflash pointof the mixedliquidshall apply.

When heated above theirflash points, Class II and IIIliquidsassume the characteristics of Class Iliquids. Under such conditions, the appropriate provisions of this chapter forflammable liquidsshall apply.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

ALCOHOL-BASED HAND RUB.

BULK PLANT OR TERMINAL.

LIQUID STORAGE WAREHOUSE.

REMOTE EMERGENCY SHUTOFF DEVICE.

REMOTE SOLVENT RESERVOIR.

SOLVENT DISTILLATION UNIT.

Areas whereflammable liquidsare stored, handled, dispensed or mixed shall be in accordance withTable5703.1.1. A classified area shall not extend beyond an unpierced floor, roof or othersolidpartition.

The extent of the classified area is allowed to be reduced, or eliminated, where sufficient technical justification is provided to thefire code officialthat a concentration in theareain excess of 25 percent of thelower flammable limit(LFL) cannot be generated.
