The totalnetexplosiveweightofmass-detonatingexplosives(Division 1.1, 1.2 or 1.5) shall be used. SeeTable 5604.5.2(1)orTable 5605.3, as appropriate.

Exception:Where the TNT equivalence of theexplosive materialhas been determined, the equivalence is allowed to be used to establish thenetexplosiveweight.

Nonmass-detonatingexplosives(excluding Division 1.4) shall be as follows:

- Division 1.3propellants. The total weight of thepropellantsalone shall be thenetexplosiveweight. Thenet weightofpropellantshall be used. SeeTable 5604.5.2(2).
- Combinations of bulk metal powder andpyrotechnic compositions. The sum of the net weights of metal powders andpyrotechnic compositionsin thecontainersshall be thenetexplosiveweight. SeeTable 5604.5.2(2).

Combination of mass-detonating and nonmass-detonatingexplosives(excluding Division 1.4) shall be as follows:

- Where Division 1.1 and 1.2explosivesare located in the samesite, determine the distance for the total quantity considered first as 1.1 and then as 1.2. The required distance is the greater of the two. Where the Division 1.1 requirements are controlling and the TNT equivalence of the 1.2 is known, the TNT equivalent weight of the 1.2 items shall be allowed to be added to the totalexplosiveweight of Division 1.1 items to determine thenetexplosiveweightfor Division 1.1 distance determination. SeeTable 5604.5.2(2)orTable 5605.3, as appropriate.
- Where Division 1.1 and 1.3explosivesare located in the samesite, determine the distances for the total quantity considered first as 1.1 and then as 1.3. The required distance is the greater of the two. Where the Division 1.1 requirements are controlling and the TNT equivalence of the 1.3 is known, the TNT equivalent weight of the 1.3 items shall be allowed to be added to the totalexplosiveweight of Division 1.1 items to determine thenetexplosiveweightfor Division 1.1 distance determination. SeeTable 5604.5.2(1),5604.5.2(2)or5605.3, as appropriate.
- Where Division 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3explosivesare located in the samesite, determine the distances for the total quantity considered first as 1.1, next as 1.2 and finally as 1.3. The required distance is the greatest of the three. As allowed by Items 1 and 2, TNT equivalent weights for 1.2 and 1.3 items are allowed to be used to determine the net weight ofexplosivesfor Division 1.1 distance determination.Table 5604.5.2(1)or5605.3shall be used where TNT equivalency is used to establish thenetexplosiveweight.
- For composite pyrotechnic items Division 1.1 and Division 1.3, the sum of the net weights of thepyrotechnic compositionand theexplosivesinvolved shall be used. SeeTables 5604.5.2(1)and5604.5.2(2).

For Division 1.4explosives, the total weight of theexplosivematerialalone is thenet weight. Thenet weightof theexplosivematerialshall be used.
