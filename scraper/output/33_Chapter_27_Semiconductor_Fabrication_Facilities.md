# Chapter 27 Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities

About this chapter:Chapter 27 provides requirements that are intended to control hazards associated with the manufacture of electrical circuit boards or microchips, commonly called semiconductors. Though the finished product possesses no unusual hazards, materials commonly associated with semiconductor manufacturing are often quite hazardous and includeflammable liquids,pyrophoricand flammable gases,toxicsubstances andcorrosives. The requirements of this chapter are concerned with both life safety and property protection. However, thefire code officialshould recognize that the risk of extraordinary property damages is far more common than the risk of personal injuries from fire.Section 415.11of theInternational Building Code®also addresses thesefacilitiesthat are classified as GroupH-5occupancies.
