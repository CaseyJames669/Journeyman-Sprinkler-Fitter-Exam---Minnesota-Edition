# Chapter 62 Organic Peroxides

About this chapter:Chapter 62 addresses the hazards associated with the storage,handlingand use oforganic peroxidesand is intended to manage the fire and oxidation hazards oforganic peroxidesby preventing their uncontrolled release. Thesechemicalspossess the characteristics of flammable orcombustible liquidsand are also strongoxidizers. This unusual combination of properties requires special storage andhandlingprecautions to prevent uncontrolled release, contamination, hazardouschemicalreactions, fires orexplosions. The requirements of this chapter pertain to industrial applications in which significant quantities oforganic peroxidesare stored or used; however, smaller quantities oforganic peroxidesstill pose a significant hazard and, therefore, must be stored and used in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter andChapter 50.

The storage and use oforganic peroxidesshall be in accordance with this chapter andChapter 50.

Unclassified detonableorganic peroxidesthat are capable ofdetonationin their normal shippingcontainersunder conditions of fire exposure shall be stored in accordance withChapter 56.

Permitsshall be required fororganic peroxidesas set forth inSection 105.6.

The following term is defined inChapter 2:

- Class I.
- Class II.
- Class III.
- Class IV.
- Class V.
- Unclassified detonable.

InGroup A, E, I or U occupancies, any amount ofunclassified detonableand Class Iorganic peroxidesshall be stored in accordance with the following:

- Unclassified detonableand Class Iorganic peroxidesshall be stored inhazardous materials storagecabinets complying withSection 5003.8.7.
- Thehazardous materials storagecabinets shall not contain other storage.

In classrooms inGroup B, F or M occupancies, any amount ofunclassified detonableand Class 1organic peroxidesshall be stored in accordance with the following.

- Unclassified detonableand Class 1organic peroxidesshall be stored inhazardous materials storagecabinets complying withSection 5003.8.7.
- Thehazardous materials storagecabinets shall not contain other storage.

Indoorstorage oforganic peroxidesin amounts exceeding themaximum allowable quantity per control areaindicated inTable 5003.1.1(1)shall be in accordance with Sections5001,5003,5004and this chapter.

Indoorstorageofunclassified detonableorganic peroxidesthat are capable ofdetonationin their normal shippingcontainersunder conditions of fire exposure shall be stored in accordance withChapter 56.

In addition to the requirements of theInternational Building Code, detachedstoragebuildings for Class I, II, III, IV and Vorganic peroxidesshall be located in accordance withTable6204.1.2.Detached buildingscontaining quantities ofunclassified detonableorganic peroxidesin excess of those set forth inTable 5003.8.2shall be located in accordance withTable 5604.5.2(1).

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound = 0.454 kg.Where the amount oforganic peroxidestored exceeds this amount, the minimum separation shall be 50 feet.

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound = 0.454 kg.

Where the amount oforganic peroxidestored exceeds this amount, the minimum separation shall be 50 feet.

- Where the amount oforganic peroxidestored exceeds this amount, the minimum separation shall be 50 feet.

Anapprovedsupervised smoke detectionsystemin accordance withSection 907shall be provided in rooms or areas where Class I, II or IIIorganic peroxidesare stored. Activation of the smoke detectionsystemshall sound a local alarm.

Exception:A smoke detectionsystemshall not be required in detached storage buildings equipped throughout with anapprovedautomatic fire-extinguishing systemcomplying withChapter 9.

Storage arrangements fororganic peroxidesshall be in accordance withTable6204.1.7 and shall comply with all of the following:

- Containersand packages in storage areas shall be closed.
- Bulk storage shall not be in piles or bins.
- A minimum 2-foot (610 mm) clear space shall be maintained between storage and uninsulated metal walls.
- Fifty-five-gallon (208 L) drums shall not be stored more than one drum high.
