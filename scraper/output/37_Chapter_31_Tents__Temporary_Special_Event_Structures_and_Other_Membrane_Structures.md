# Chapter 31 Tents, Temporary Special Event Structures and Other Membrane Structures

About this chapter:Chapter 31 provides requirements that are intended to protect temporary as well as permanenttentsand air-supported and othermembrane structuresand temporary stage special event structures from fire and similar hazards. The provisions regulate structure location andaccess, anchorage, egress, heat-producing equipment,hazardous materialsand operations, combustible vegetation, ignition sources, and waste accumulation. This is accomplished through requiring regular inspections and certifying continued compliance with fire safety regulations. This chapter also addressesoutdoor assembly events, which are not limited to those events withtentsor othermembrane structures, but are regulated due to the number of people, density of those people and hazards associated with large outdoor events related to egress, fire hazards from cooking and other related concerns.

Tents,temporary special event structuresandmembrane structuresshall comply with this chapter. The provisions ofSection 3103are applicable only to temporarytentsandmembrane structures. The provisions of Sections3104and3106are applicable to temporary and permanenttentsandmembrane structures. The provisions ofSection 3105are applicable totemporary special event structures. The provisions ofSection 3106are applicable tooutdoor assembly events. Other temporary structures shall comply with theInternational Building Code.
