# Chapter 53 Compressed Gases

About this chapter:Chapter 53 regulates thestorage, use andhandlingof all flammable and nonflammable compressed gases, such as those that are used in medicalfacilities, air separation plants, industrial plants, agricultural equipment and similar occupancies. Also, this chapter regulates inert gases, such as CO2used for enrichment and beveragedispensing, that although inert are considered asphyxiants and in larger amounts pose a life safety hazard. Standards for the design, construction and marking ofcompressed gascylindersandpressure vesselsare referenced. Compressed gases used in welding and cutting, cryogenicliquidsand liquefied petroleum gases are also regulated under Chapters35,55and61, respectively. Compressed gases that are classified ashazardous materialsare also regulated inChapter 50, which includes general requirements.
