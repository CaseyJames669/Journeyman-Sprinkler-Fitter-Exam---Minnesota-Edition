# Chapter 67 Water-Reactive Solids and Liquids

About this chapter:Chapter 67 addresses the hazards associated withwater-reactive materialsthat aresolidorliquidat normal temperatures and pressures. In addition to their water reactivity, these materials may pose a wide range of other hazards, such as toxicity, flammability, corrosiveness or oxidizing potential. This chapter addresses only those materials whose primary hazard is water reactivity. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of this code with respect to all hazards. Strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping andstoragearrangements, helps to reduce the exposure to hazards associated withwater-reactive materialsin a fire or other emergency.

Water-reactivesolidsandliquidsstored in quantities greater than 500 cubic feet (14 m3) shall be separated into piles, each not larger than 500 cubic feet (14 m3).Aislewidths between piles shall be not less than the height of the pile or 4 feet (1219 mm), whichever is greater.

Exception:Water-reactivesolidsandliquidsstored intanks.

Class 2 water-reactivesolidsandliquidsshall not be stored inbasementsunless such materials are stored in closed water-tightcontainersortanks.

Class 3 water-reactivesolidsandliquidsshall not be stored inbasements.
