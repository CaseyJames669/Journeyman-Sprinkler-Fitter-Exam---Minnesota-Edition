Subdivision 1. MS 2006 [Renumbered 326B.02, subd 6]

Subd. 2. [Repealed, 1981 c 106 s 16]

Subd. 3. Rules for code administration and enforcement. The commissioner of public safety shall adopt rules as may be necessary to administer and enforce the code, specifically including but not limited to rules for inspection of buildings and other structures covered by the code and conforming the code to the governmental organization of Minnesota state agencies, political subdivisions and local governments.

Subd. 4. Applicability; local authority. The State Fire Code shall be applicable throughout the state and in all political subdivisions and municipalities therein. However, nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit a local unit of government otherwise authorized by law from adopting or enforcing any ordinance or regulation which specifies requirements equal to, in addition to, or more stringent than the requirements of the State Fire Code. Any ordinance or regulation adopted by a local unit which differs from the State Fire Code must be directly related to the safeguarding of life and property from the hazards of fire, must be uniform for each class or kind of building covered, and may not exceed the applicable requirements of the State Building Code adopted pursuant to sections 326B.101 to 326B.151.

Subd. 4a. Day care home regulation.

(a)	Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this section, the fire marshal shall not adopt or enforce a rule:

(1)	establishing staff ratios, age distribution requirements, and limitations on the number of children in care;

(2)	regulating the means of egress from family or group family day care homes in addition to the egress rules that apply to the home as a single family dwelling; or

(3)	confining family or group family day care home activities to the floor of exit discharge.

(b)	For purposes of this subdivision, “family or group family day care home” means a dwelling unit in which the day care provider provides the services referred to in Section 245A.02, subdivision 10, to one or more persons.

(c)	Nothing in this subdivision prohibits the Department of Human Services from adopting or enforcing rules regulating day care, including the subjects in paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (3). The department may not, however, adopt or enforce a rule stricter than paragraph (a), clause (2).

(d)	The Department of Human Services may by rule adopt procedures for requesting the state fire marshal or a local fire marshal to conduct an inspection of day care homes to ensure compliance with state or local fire codes.

(e)	The commissioners of public safety and human services may enter into an agreement for the commissioner of human services to perform follow-up inspections of programs, subject to licensure under chapter 245A, to determine whether certain violations cited by the state fire marshal have been corrected. The agreement shall identify specific items the commissioner of human services is permitted to inspect. The list of items is not subject to rulemaking and may be changed by mutual agreement between the state fire marshal and the commissioner. The agreement shall provide for training of individuals who will conduct follow-up inspections. The agreement shall contain procedures for the commissioner of human services to follow when the commissioner requires assistance from the state fire marshal to carry out the duties of the agreement.

(f)	No tort liability is transferred to the commissioner of human services as a result of the commissioner of human services performing activities within the limits of the agreement.

Subd. 4b. Stairway. The State Fire Code shall not require stairways of existing multiple dwelling buildings of two stories or less to be enclosed. For the purposes of this subdivision the term “stories” has the meaning given it in the State Building Code.

Subd. 4c. [Repealed, 2005 c 136 art 9 s 15]

Subd. 5. Appeal policy; variance. Upon application, the state fire marshal may grant variances from the minimum requirements specified in the code if there is substantial compliance with the provisions of the code, the safety of the public and occupants of such building will not be jeopardized, and undue hardship will result to the applicant unless such variance is granted. No appeal to the state fire marshal for a variance from orders issued by a local fire official from the State Fire Code shall be accepted until the applicant has first made application to the local governing body and the local unit has acted on the application. The state fire marshal shall consider any decisions or recommendations of the local governing body. Any person aggrieved by a decision made by the fire marshal under this subdivision may proceed before the fire marshal as with a contested case in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.

Subd. 5a. Local board of appeal. Local governing bodies may appoint boards of appeal to hear and rule on appeals from orders issued under the fire code. An appeal from a local board of appeal may be made to the local governing body. If a board of appeal is not appointed, the appeals of orders must be made directly to the governing body. Local boards of appeal and governing bodies are not liable for damages in connection with granting variances, abatements, denials, or modifications of orders from the fire code that are made in good faith.

Subd. 5b. Variance considerations. When considering appeals for variances from the fire code, the local appeal board or governing body, the state fire marshal, a state administrative law judge, and a court shall take into consideration the benefit to be obtained by complying with the fire marshal’s orders and the effect on affordable housing, provided that the spirit of the code is complied with and public safety secured.

Subd. 6. Misdemeanor. A person who violates a provision of the State Fire Code shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. No person shall be convicted for violating the State Fire Code unless the person shall have been given notice of the violation in writing and reasonable time to comply. The notice must contain a statement explaining the right to appeal the orders.

The judge may also order the person in whose possession the containers are found to appear, and inquire into the circumstances of the possession. If the judge finds that the person has been guilty of a violation of this section, the judge shall impose the punishment prescribed, and award the property taken upon the search warrant to its owner.

Subd. 6. Misdemeanor. Any person who shall fail to comply with any of the foregoing provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor for each separate offense.

In the performance of the duties imposed by the provisions of this chapter, the state fire marshal and subordinates, during and within a reasonable time after a fire has been extinguished, may enter any building or premises where a fire has occurred and other buildings and premises adjoining or near thereto to investigate and gather evidence. In determining whether a search is reasonable within the meaning of this subdivision, the need for investigatory search for the cause of the fire shall be balanced against the privacy rights of the occupant or owner of the building or premises.

Subd. 2. Administrative search warrant.

(a)	After the reasonable time prescribed by subdivision 1 for an investigatory search has expired, subsequent entries to the building or premises to investigate and gather evidence may be made only if there is consent from the owner or occupant of the building or premises or pursuant to an administrative search warrant issued by a judge.

Subd. 3. Criminal search warrant. If during the course of an investigatory search under an administrative search warrant issued in accordance with subdivision 2, the fire marshal or subordinates find probable cause to believe arson has occurred and require further access to the building or premises to gather evidence for possible prosecution, a criminal search warrant must be obtained from a judge.

Subd. 4. Securing the scene. In order to prevent the loss, destruction, or alteration of evidence at a fire scene, fire officials may secure fire scenes for up to 48 hours after having extinguished the fire while warrants are obtained or while the investigation authorized in this section is conducted. Fire scene security may be accomplished by preventing any person from entering the fire scene or from removing property from the fire scene. An individual may enter the fire scene if accompanied by the fire official conducting the investigation, or if the individual obtains the fire official’s written permission. Persons not complying with the fire security measures under this subdivision are guilty of obstructing legal process as defined in Section 609.50. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to increase the civil liability of fire officials or to decrease municipal or state immunities as set forth in Section 3.736 or 466.03.

PREFACE
Introduction

The International Fire Code® (IFC®) establishes minimum requirements for fire prevention and fire protection systems using prescriptive and performance-related provisions. It is founded on broad-based principles that make possible the use of new materials and new system designs. This 2018 edition is fully compatible with all of the International Codes® (I-Codes®) published by the International Code Council® (ICC®), including the International Building Code®, International Energy Conservation Code®, International Existing Building Code®, International Fuel Gas Code®, International Green Construction Code®, International Mechanical Code®, International Plumbing Code®, International Private Sewage Disposal Code®, International Property Maintenance Code®, International Residential Code®, International Swimming Pool and Spa Code®, International Wildland-Urban Interface Code®, International Zoning Code® and International Code Council Performance Code®.

The I-Codes, including this International Fire Code, are used in a variety of ways in both the public and private sectors. Most industry professionals are familiar with the I-Codes as the basis of laws and regulations in communities across the U.S. and in other countries. However, the impact of the codes extends well beyond the regulatory arena, as they are used in a variety of nonregulatory settings, including:

•	Voluntary compliance programs such as those promoting sustainability, energy efficiency and disaster resistance.

•	The insurance industry, to estimate and manage risk, and as a tool in underwriting and rate decisions.

•	Certification and credentialing of individuals involved in the fields of building design, construction and safety.

•	Certification of building and construction-related products.

•	U.S. federal agencies, to guide construction in an array of government-owned properties.

•	Facilities management.

•	“Best practices” benchmarks for designers and builders, including those who are engaged in projects in jurisdictions that do not have a formal regulatory system or a governmental enforcement mechanism.

•	College, university and professional school textbooks and curricula.

•	Reference works related to building design and construction.

In addition to the codes themselves, the code development process brings together building professionals on a regular basis. It provides an international forum for discussion and deliberation about building design, construction methods, safety, performance requirements, technological advances and innovative products.

Development

This 2018 edition presents the code as originally issued, with changes reflected in the 2003 through 2015 editions and further changes approved through the ICC Code Development Process through 2017. A new edition such as this is promulgated every 3 years.

This code is founded on principles intended to establish provisions consistent with the scope of a fire code that adequately protects public health, safety and welfare; provisions that do not unnecessarily increase construction costs; provisions that do not restrict the use of new materials, products or methods of construction; and provisions that do not give preferential treatment to particular types or classes of materials, products or methods of construction.

Maintenance

The International Fire Code is kept up to date through the review of proposed changes submitted by code enforcement officials, industry representatives, design professionals and other interested parties. Proposed changes are carefully considered through an open code development process in which all interested and affected parties may participate.

The ICC Code Development Process reflects principles of openness, transparency, balance, due process and consensus, the principles embodied in OMB Circular A-119, which governs the federal government’s use of private-sector standards. The ICC process is open to anyone; there is no cost to participate, and people can participate without travel cost through the ICC’s cloud-based app, cdpAccess®. A broad cross section of interests are represented in the ICC Code Development Process. The codes, which are updated regularly, include safeguards that allow for emergency action when required for health and safety reasons.

In order to ensure that organizations with a direct and material interest in the codes have a voice in the process, the ICC has developed partnerships with key industry segments that support the ICC’s important public safety mission. Some code development committee members were nominated by the following industry partners and approved by the ICC Board:

•	American Institute of Architects (AIA)

•	International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC)

•	National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)

•	National Association of State Fire Marshals (NASFM)

The code development committees evaluate and make recommendations regarding proposed changes to the codes. Their recommendations are then subject to public comment and council-wide votes. The ICC’s governmental members—public safety officials who have no financial or business interest in the outcome—cast the final votes on proposed changes.

The contents of this work are subject to change through the code development cycles and by any governmental entity that enacts the code into law. For more information regarding the code development process, contact the Codes and Standards Development Department of the International Code Council.

While the I-Code development procedure is thorough and comprehensive, the ICC, its members and those participating in the development of the codes disclaim any liability resulting from the publication or use of the I-Codes, or from compliance or noncompliance with their provisions. The ICC does not have the power or authority to police or enforce compliance with the contents of this code.

Code Development Committee Responsibilities
(Letter Designations in Front of Section Numbers)

In each code development cycle, proposed changes to the code are considered at the Committee Action Hearings by the International Fire Code Development Committee, whose action constitutes a recommendation to the voting membership for final action on the proposed change. Proposed changes to a code section that has a number beginning with a letter designation in brackets are considered by a different code development committee. For example, proposed changes to code sections that have [BE] in front of them (e.g., [BE] 606.3) are considered by the appropriate International Building Code Development Committee (IBC—Egress) at the code development hearings.

The content of sections in this code that begin with a letter designation is maintained by another code development committee in accordance with the following:

[A]= Administrative Code Development Committee;[BE]= IBC—Egress Code Development Committee;[BF]= IBC—Fire Safety Code Development Committee;[BG]= IBC—General Code Development Committee;[BS]= IBC—Structural Code Development Committee;[EB]= International Existing Building Code Development Committee;[FG]= International Fuel Gas Code Development Committee;[M]= International Mechanical Code Development Committee; and[P]= International Plumbing Code Development Committee.

For the development of the 2021 edition of the I-Codes, there will be two groups of code development committees and they will meet in separate years.

Group A Codes

Note: Proposed changes to the ICC Performance Code™ will be heard by the code development committee noted in brackets [ ] in the text of the ICC Performance Code™.

The majority of the sections of Chapter 1 of this code are designated as the responsibility of the Administrative Code Development Committee, and that committee is part of the Group B portion of the hearings. This committee will conduct its code development hearings in 2019 to consider most code change proposals for Chapter 1 of this code and proposals for Chapter 1 of all I-Codes except the International Energy Conservation Code, International Residential Code and International Green Construction Code. Therefore, any proposals received for the sections of Chapter 1 preceded by the designation [A] will be deferred for consideration in 2019 by the Administrative Code Development Committee.

It is very important that anyone submitting code change proposals understands which code development committee is responsible for the section of the code that is the subject of the code change proposal. For further information on the Code Development Committee responsibilities, please visit the ICC website at www.iccsafe.org/scoping.

Information Boxes

State Fire Marshal staff have added Information Boxes, such as this one, after some code sections to further explain the intent of a section or to direct you to further information. It is important to note that any interpretation is not code and meant only for information and clarification.

Coordination between the International Building and Fire Codes

Because the coordination of technical provisions is one of the benefits of adopting the ICC family of model codes, users will find the ICC codes to be a very flexible set of model documents. To accomplish this flexibility some technical provisions are duplicated in some of the model code documents. While the International Codes are provided as a comprehensive set of model codes for the built environment, documents are occasionally adopted as a stand-alone regulation. When one of the model documents is adopted as the basis of a stand-alone code, that code should provide a complete package of requirements with enforcement assigned to the entity for which the adoption is being made.

The model codes can also be adopted as a family of complementary codes. When adopted together, there should be no conflict of any of the technical provisions. When multiple model codes are adopted in a jurisdiction it is important for the adopting authority to evaluate the provisions in each code document and determine how and by which agency(ies) they will be enforced. It is important, therefore, to understand that where technical provisions are duplicated in multiple model documents that enforcement duties must be clearly assigned by the local adopting jurisdiction. ICC remains committed to providing state-of-the-art model code documents that, when adopted locally, will reduce the cost to government of code adoption and enforcement and protect the public health, safety and welfare.

Italicized Terms

Words and terms defined in Chapter 2, Definitions, are italicized where they appear in code text and the Chapter 2 definition applies. Where such words and terms are not italicized, common-use definitions apply. The words and terms selected have code-specific definitions that the user should read carefully to facilitate better understanding of the code.

Adoption

The International Code Council maintains a copyright in all of its codes and standards. Maintaining copyright allows ICC to fund its mission through sales of books, in both print and electronic formats. The ICC welcomes adoption of its codes by jurisdictions that recognize and acknowledge the ICC’s copyright in the code, and further acknowledge the substantial shared value of the public/private partnership for code development between jurisdictions and the ICC.

The ICC also recognizes the need for jurisdictions to make laws available to the public. All I-Codes and I-Standards, along with the laws of many jurisdictions, are available for free in a nondownloadable form on the ICC’s website. Jurisdictions should contact the ICC at adoptions@iccsafe.org to learn how to adopt and distribute laws based on the International Fire Code in a manner that provides necessary access, while maintaining the ICC’s copyright.

To facilitate adoption, several sections of this code contain blanks for fill-in information that needs to be supplied by the adopting jurisdiction as part of the adoption legislation. For this code, please see:

Section 101.1. Insert: [NAME OF JURISDICTION]

EFFECTIVE USE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FIRE CODE

The International Fire Code® (IFC®) is a model code that regulates minimum fire safety requirements for new and existing buildings, facilities, storage and processes. The IFC addresses fire prevention, fire protection, life safety and safe storage and use of hazardous materials in new and existing buildings, facilities and processes. The IFC provides a total approach of controlling hazards in all buildings and sites, regardless of the hazard being indoors or outdoors.

The IFC is a design document. For example, before one constructs a building, the site must be provided with an adequate water supply for fire-fighting operations and a means of building access for emergency responders in the event of a medical emergency, fire or natural or technological disaster. Depending on the building’s occupancy and uses, the IFC regulates the various hazards that may be housed within the building, including refrigeration systems, application of flammable finishes, fueling of motor vehicles, high-piled combustible storage and the storage and use of hazardous materials. The IFC sets forth minimum requirements for these and other hazards and contains requirements for maintaining the life safety of building occupants, the protection of emergency responders, and to limit the damage to a building and its contents as the result of a fire, explosion or unauthorized hazardous material discharge.

As described, the IFC has many types of requirements for buildings and facilities. The applicability of these requirements varies. An understanding of the applicability of requirements, as addressed in Sections 102.1 and 102.2, is necessary. Section 102.1 addresses when the construction and design provisions are applicable whereas Section 102.2 addresses when the administrative, operational and maintenance provisions are applicable. Generally, the construction and design provisions only apply to new buildings or existing buildings and occupancies as addressed by Chapter 11. The administrative, maintenance and operational requirements are applicable to all buildings and facilities whether new or existing.

Arrangement and Format of the 2018 IFC

Before applying the requirements of the IFC it is beneficial to understand its arrangement and format. The IFC, like other codes published by the International Code Council, is arranged and organized to follow sequential steps that generally occur during a plan review or inspection. In the 2012 edition, the IFC was reorganized into seven parts as illustrated in the tables below. Each part represents a broad subject matter and includes the chapters that logically fit under the subject matter of each part. It is also foreseeable that additional chapters will need to be added in the future as regulations for new processes or operations are developed. Accordingly, the reorganization was designed to accommodate such future chapters by providing reserved (unused) chapters in several of the parts. This will allow the subject matter parts to be conveniently and logically expanded without requiring a major renumbering of the IFC chapters.

ORGANIZATION OF THE IFC
Parts and Chapters	Subject Matter
Part I—Chapters 1 and 2	Administrative and definitions
Part II—Chapters 3 and 4	General safety provisions
Part III—Chapters 5 through 12	Building and equipment design features
Part III—Chapters 13 through 19	Reserved for future use
Part IV—Chapters 20 through 39	Special occupancies and operations
Part IV—Chapters 40 through 49; 52	Reserved for future use
Part V—Chapters 50, 51 and 53 through 67	Hazardous materials
Part V—Chapters 68 through 79	Reserved for future use
Part VI—Chapter 80	Referenced standards
Part VII—Appendices A through P	Adoptable and informational appendices

The IFC requirements for fire-resistive construction, interior finish, fire protection systems, means of egress and construction safeguards are directly correlated to the chapters containing parallel requirements in the IBC, as follows:

IFC Chapter	Subject
7	Fire and smoke protection features
8	Interior finish, decorative materials and furnishings
9	Fire protection and life safety systems
10	Means of egress
33	Fire safety during construction and demolition

The following is a chapter-by-chapter synopsis of the scope and intent of the provisions of the International Fire Code:

PART I–ADMINISTRATIVE

Chapter 1 Scope and Administration. This chapter contains provisions for the application, enforcement and administration of subsequent requirements of the code. In addition to establishing the scope of the code, Chapter 1 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview. Chapter 1 is largely concerned with maintaining “due process of law” in enforcing the regulations contained in the body of the code. Only through careful observation of the administrative provisions can the code official reasonably expect to demonstrate that “equal protection under the law” has been provided.

Chapter 2 Definitions. All terms that are defined in the code are listed alphabetically in Chapter 2. While a defined term may be used in one chapter or another, the meaning provided in Chapter 2 is applicable throughout the code.

Where understanding of a term’s definition is especially key to or necessary for understanding of a particular code provision, the term is shown in italics wherever it appears in the code. This is true only for those terms that have a meaning that is unique to the code. In other words, the generally understood meaning of a term or phrase might not be sufficient or consistent with the meaning prescribed by the code; therefore, it is essential that the code-defined meaning be known.

Guidance regarding tense, gender and plurality of defined terms as well as guidance regarding terms not defined in this code are also provided.

PART II–GENERAL SAFETY PROVISIONS

Chapter 3 General Requirements. The open burning, ignition source, vacant building, miscellaneous storage, roof gardens and landscaped roofs, outdoor pallet storage and hazards to fire fighters requirements and precautions, among other general regulations contained in this chapter, are intended to improve premises safety for everyone, including construction workers, tenants, operations and maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 302 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 4 Emergency Planning and Preparedness. This chapter addresses the human contribution to life safety in buildings when a fire or other emergency occurs. The requirements for continuous training and scheduled fire, evacuation and lockdown drills can be as important as the required periodic inspections and maintenance of built-in fire protection features. The level of preparation by the occupants also improves the emergency responders’ abilities during an emergency. The International Building Code (IBC) focuses on built-in fire protection features, such as automatic sprinkler systems, fire-resistance-rated construction and properly designed egress systems, whereas this chapter fully addresses the human element. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 402 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

PART III–BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN FEATURES

Chapter 5 Fire Service Features. The requirements of this chapter apply to all buildings and occupancies and pertain to access roads; access to building openings and roofs; premises identification; key boxes; fire protection water supplies; fire command centers; fire department access to equipment and emergency responder radio coverage in buildings. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 502 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 6 Building Services and Systems. This chapter focuses on building systems and services as they relate to potential safety hazards and when and how they should be installed. This chapter brings together all building system- and service-related issues for convenience and provides a more systematic view of buildings. The following building services and systems are addressed: fuel-fired appliances (Section 603), electrical equipment, wiring and hazards (Section 604), mechanical refrigeration (Section 605), elevator recall and maintenance (Section 606), commercial kitchen hoods (Section 607), commercial kitchen cooking oil storage (608) and hyperbaric facilities (609). As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 602 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents. Note that building systems focused on energy systems and components are addressed by Chapter 12.

Chapter 7 Fire and Smoke Protection Features. The maintenance of assemblies required to be fire-resistance rated is a key component in a passive fire protection philosophy. Chapter 7 sets forth requirements to maintain required fire-resistance ratings of building elements and limit fire spread. Section 701 addresses the basics of what construction elements such as fire barriers and smoke barriers need to be maintained as well as defining the owner’s responsibility. The rest of the chapter, Sections 703 through 706, deals with various fire and smoke protection features that must also be maintained. These features include penetrations, joint protection, door and window openings and duct and air transfer opening protection. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 702 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 8 Interior Finish, Decorative Materials and Furnishings. The overall purpose of Chapter 8 is to regulate interior finishes, decorative materials and furnishings in new and existing buildings so that they do not significantly add to or create fire hazards within buildings. The provisions tend to focus on occupancies with specific risk characteristics, such as vulnerability of occupants, density of occupants, lack of familiarity with the building and societal expectations of importance. This chapter is consistent with Chapter 8 of the International Building Code (IBC), which regulates the interior finishes of new buildings. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 802 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 9 Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems. Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active systems of fire protection equipment to perform the functions of detecting a fire, alerting the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency, controlling smoke and controlling or extinguishing the fire. There are provisions relating to gas detection and associated alarms. Mass notification systems are also addressed. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building, because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of the International Building Code; however, this chapter also contains periodic testing criteria that are not contained in the IBC. In addition, the special fire protection system requirements based on use and occupancy found in Chapter 4 of the IBC are duplicated in Chapter 9 of the IFC as a user convenience. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 902 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 10 Means of Egress. The general criteria set forth in Chapter 10 regulating the design of the means of egress are established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system (i.e., exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics also are specified for the components that will permit their safe use without special knowledge or effort. The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Sections 1002 through 1030 duplicate text from Chapter 10 of the IBC; however, the IFC contains an additional Section 1031 on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings. Retroactive minimum means of egress requirements for existing buildings are found in Chapter 11.

Chapter 11 Construction Requirements for Existing Buildings. Chapter 11 applies to existing buildings constructed prior to the adoption of the code and intends to provide a minimum degree of fire and life safety to persons occupying existing buildings by providing for alterations to such buildings that do not comply with the minimum requirements of the International Building Code. Prior to the 2009 edition, its content existed in the IFC but in a random manner that was neither efficient nor user-friendly. In the 2007/2008 code development cycle, a code change (F294-07/08) was approved that consolidated the retroactive elements of IFC/2006 Sections 607, 701, 704, 903, 905, 907 and 3406 (then 2506) and all of then-Section 1027 (Means of Egress for Existing Buildings) into a single chapter for easier and more efficient reference and application to existing buildings. The provisions address general fire safety features such as requirements for fire alarm systems, CO detection and automatic sprinkler systems in some existing buildings, general means of egress, and finally, the chapter contains a section dedicated to existing Group I-2 occupancies. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 1102 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 12 Energy Systems. Chapter 12 was added to address the current energy systems found in the IFC. It introduces a wide range of systems that generate and store energy in, on and adjacent to buildings and facilities. The expansion of such energy systems is related to meeting today’s energy, environmental and economic challenges. Ensuring appropriate criteria to address the safety of such systems in building and fire codes is an important part of protecting the public at large, building occupants and emergency responders. Previously, requirements for energy systems, such as standby power systems, PV systems and stationary battery systems, were scattered about in various locations in Chapter 6, which addresses building services and systems. However, with the addition of fuel cells and capacitor energy storage systems to the IFC, a chapter dedicated to such related issues needed to be created. This chapter provides an appropriate location for the addition of future energy systems.

Chapters 13 through 19. Reserved for future use.

PART IV–SPECIAL OCCUPANCIES AND OPERATIONS

Chapter 20 Aviation Facilities. Chapter 20 specifies minimum requirements for the fire-safe operation of airports, heliports and helistops. The principal nonflight operational hazards associated with aviation involve fuel, facilities and operations. Therefore, safe use of flammable and combustible liquids during fueling and maintenance operations is emphasized. Availability of portable Class B:C-rated fire extinguishers for prompt control or suppression of incipient fires is required. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2002 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 21 Dry Cleaning. The provisions of Chapter 21 are intended to reduce hazards associated with use of flammable and combustible dry cleaning solvents. These materials, like all volatile organic chemicals, generate significant quantities of static electricity and are thus readily ignitable. Many flammable and nonflammable dry cleaning solvents also possess health hazards when involved in a fire. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2102 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 22 Combustible Dust-producing Operations. The requirements of Chapter 22 seek to reduce the likelihood of dust explosions by managing the hazards of ignitable suspensions of combustible dusts associated with a variety of operations including woodworking, mining, food processing, agricultural commodity storage and handling and pharmaceutical manufacturing, among others. Ignition source control and good housekeeping practices in occupancies containing dust-producing operations are emphasized. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2202 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 23 Motor Fuel-dispensing Facilities and Repair Garages. This chapter provides provisions that regulate the storage and dispensing of both liquid and gaseous motor fuels at public and private automotive, marine and aircraft motor fuel-dispensing facilities, fleet vehicle motor fuel-dispensing facilities and repair garages. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2302 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 24 Flammable Finishes. Chapter 24 requirements govern operations where flammable or combustible finishes are applied by spraying, dipping, powder coating or flow-coating processes. As with all operations involving flammable or combustible liquids and combustible dusts or vapors, controlling ignition sources and methods of reducing or controlling flammable vapors or combustible dusts at or near these operations are emphasized. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2402 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 25 Fruit and Crop Ripening. Chapter 25 provides guidance that is intended to reduce the likelihood of explosions resulting from improper use or handling of ethylene gas used for cropripening and coloring processes. This is accomplished by regulating ethylene gas generation; storage and distribution systems and controlling ignition sources. Design and construction of facilities for this use are regulated by the International Building Code to reduce the impact of potential accidents on people and buildings.

Chapter 26 Fumigation and Insecticidal Fogging. This chapter regulates fumigation and insecticidal fogging operations which use toxic pesticide chemicals to kill insects, rodents and other vermin. Fumigants and insecticidal fogging agents pose little hazard if properly applied; however, the inherent toxicity of all these agents and the potential flammability of some makes special precautions necessary when they are used. Requirements of this chapter are intended to protect both the public and fire fighters from hazards associated with these products. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2602 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 27 Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities. The requirements of this chapter are intended to control hazards associated with the manufacture of electrical circuit boards or microchips, commonly called semiconductors. Though the finished product possesses no unusual hazards, materials commonly associated with semiconductor manufacturing are often quite hazardous and include flammable liquids, pyrophoric and flammable gases, toxic substances and corrosives. The requirements of this chapter are concerned with both life safety and property protection. However, the fire code official should recognize that the risk of extraordinary property damages is far more common than the risk of personal injuries from fire. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2702 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 28 Lumber Yards and Agro-industrial, Solid Biomass and Woodworking Facilities. Provisions of this chapter are intended to prevent fires and explosions, facilitate fire control and reduce exposures to and from facilities storing, selling or processing wood and forest products, including sawdust, wood chips, shavings, bark mulch, shorts, finished planks, sheets, posts, poles, timber and raw logs and the hazard they represent once ignited. Also included are solid biomass feedstock and raw products associated with agro-industrial facilities, the outdoor storage of pallets and manufacturing and recycling facilities. This chapter requires active and passive fire protection features to reduce on- and off-site exposures, limit fire size and development and facilitate fire fighting by employees and the fire service. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2802 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 29 Manufacture of Organic Coatings. This chapter regulates materials and processes associated with the manufacture of paints as well as bituminous, asphaltic and other diverse compounds formulated to protect buildings, machines and objects from the effects of weather, corrosion and hostile environmental exposures. Paint for decorative, architectural and industrial uses comprises the bulk of organic coating production. Painting and processes related to the manufacture of nonflammable and noncombustible or water-based products are exempt from the provisions of this chapter. The application of organic coatings is covered by Chapter 24. Elimination of ignition sources, maintenance of fire protection equipment and isolation or segregation of hazardous operations are emphasized. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 2902 contains a term that is defined in Chapter 2 and is applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 30 Industrial Ovens. This chapter addresses the fuel supply, ventilation, emergency shutdown equipment, fire protection and the operation and maintenance of industrial ovens, which are sometimes referred to as industrial heat enclosures or industrial furnaces. Compliance with this chapter is intended to reduce the likelihood of fires involving industrial ovens which are usually the result of the fuel in use or volatile vapors given off by the materials being heated or to manage the impact if a fire should occur. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 3002 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 31 Tents, Temporary Structures and Other Membrane Structures. The requirements in this chapter are intended to protect temporary as well as permanent tents and air-supported and other membrane structures and temporary special event structures from fire and similar hazards by regulating structure location and access, anchorage, egress, heat-producing equipment, hazardous materials and operations, combustible vegetation, ignition sources, waste accumulation and requiring regular inspections and certifying continued compliance with fire safety regulations. This chapter also addresses outdoor assembly events, which are not limited to those events where tents or other membrane structures are used but are regulated due to the number of people, density of those people and hazards associated with large outdoor events related to egress, fire hazards from cooking and other related concerns. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 3102 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 32 High-piled Combustible Storage. This chapter provides guidance for reasonable protection of life from hazards associated with the storage of combustible materials in closely packed piles or on pallets, in racks or on shelves where the top of storage is greater than 12 feet in height. It provides requirements for identifying various classes of commodities; general fire and life safety features including storage arrangements, smoke and heat venting, and fire department access; and housekeeping and maintenance requirements. The chapter attempts to define the potential fire severity and, in turn, determine fire and life safety protection measures needed to control, and in some cases suppress, a potential fire. This chapter does not cover miscellaneous combustible materials storage regulated in Section 315. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 3202 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 33 Fire Safety during Construction and Demolition. Chapter 33 outlines general fire safety precautions for all structures and all occupancies during construction and demolition operations. In general, these requirements seek to maintain required levels of fire protection, limit fire spread, establish the appropriate operation of equipment and promote prompt response to fire emergencies. Features regulated include fire protection systems, fire fighter access to the site and building, means of egress, hazardous materials storage and use and temporary heating equipment and other ignition sources. With the 2012 reorganization, this chapter now correlates with Chapter 33 of the IBC.

Chapter 34 Tire Rebuilding and Tire Storage. The requirements of Chapter 34 are intended to prevent or control fires and explosions associated with the remanufacture and storage of tires and tire byproducts. Additionally, the requirements are intended to minimize the impact of indoor and outdoor tire storage fires by regulating pile volume and location, segregating the various operations, providing for fire department access and a water supply and controlling ignition sources.

Chapter 35 Welding and Other Hot Work. This chapter covers requirements for safety in welding and other types of hot work by reducing the potential for fire ignitions that usually result in large losses. Several different types of hot work would fall under the requirements found in Chapter 35, including both gas and electric arc methods and any open-torch operations. Many of the activities of this chapter focus on the actions of the occupants. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 3502 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 36 Marinas. Chapter 36 addresses the fire protection and prevention requirements for marinas. It was developed in response to the complications encountered by a number of fire departments responsible for the protection of marinas as well as fire loss history in marinas that lacked fire protection. Compliance with this chapter intends to establish safe practices in marina areas, provide an identification method for mooring spaces in the marina, and provide fire fighters with safe operational areas and fire protection methods to extend hose lines in a safe manner. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 3602 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 37 Combustible Fibers. Chapter 37 establishes the requirements for storage and handling of combustible fibers, including animal, vegetable and synthetic fibers, whether woven into textiles, baled, packaged or loose. Operations involving combustible fibers are typically associated with salvage, paper milling, recycling, cloth manufacturing, carpet and textile mills and agricultural operations, among others. The primary hazard associated with these operations is the abundance of materials and their ready ignitability. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 3702 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 38 Higher Education Laboratories. Chapter 38 is a new chapter addressing the unique needs of laboratories in higher education academic institutions. The advancement of technologies, science, medicine and our knowledge of the world often relies on having vibrant and successful academic institutions. These academic institutions often have chemistry, biology, medical, engineering and other laboratories where hazardous materials are used. The chapter addresses both new and existing buildings and new and existing laboratories. Applying the general hazardous material provisions has been difficult because of the ways these laboratories operate. Often there are many small laboratories that use very small quantities of hazardous materials that individually do not exceed the MAQs. However, in aggregate the quantities will exceed the MAQs and could result in the need for a Group H occupancy classification. It is believed that the lower density of hazardous materials often mitigates the overall risk. Therefore, this lower density along with a package of additional requirements (including the concept of laboratory suites with fire-resistance-rated separations) renders a Group H occupancy classification not necessary. This chapter also addresses the use of certain materials typically prohibited for existing buildings where located in buildings not protected throughout with a sprinkler system. These allowances come with certain safety measures such as the use of storage cabinets and fume hoods.

Chapter 39 Processing and Extraction Facilities. Chapter 39 is a new chapter focused on the processing and extraction of oils and fats from various plants. This process includes the extraction by use of solvent, desolventizing of the raw material and production of the miscella, and distillation of the solvent from the miscella and solvent recovery. The processes used are not necessarily typical hazardous material processes and often the systems and equipment associated with such processes are not listed. Due to the typical lack of listings, the systems and equipment need specific approvals for each installation. This chapter provides the tools to appropriately enforce the IFC to meet the unique needs of industry while providing the appropriate level of safety. This chapter has provisions for a technical report prepared by a registered design professional. This chapter also requires site inspections to make sure equipment and systems are installed as designed and approved.

Chapters 40 through 49. Reserved for future use.

PART V–HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Chapter 50 Hazardous Materials—General Provisions. This chapter contains the general requirements for all hazardous chemicals in all occupancies. Hazardous chemicals are defined as those that pose an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of operating or emergency personnel, the public and the environment if not properly controlled during handling, storage, manufacture, processing, packaging, use, disposal or transportation. The general provisions of this chapter are intended to be companion provisions with the specific requirements of Chapters 51 through 67 regarding a given hazardous material. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5002 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 51 Aerosols. Chapter 51 addresses the prevention, control and extinguishment of fires and explosions in facilities where retail aerosol products are displayed or stored. It is concerned with both life safety and property protection from a fire; however, historically, aerosol product fires have caused property loss more frequently than loss of life. Requirements for storing aerosol products are dependent on the level of aerosol product, level of sprinkler protection, type of storage condition and quantity of aerosol products. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5102 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 52. Reserved for future use.

Chapter 53 Compressed Gases. This chapter regulates the storage, use and handling of all flammable and nonflammable compressed gases, such as those that are used in medical facilities, air separation plants, industrial plants, agricultural equipment facilities and similar occupancies. Standards for the design, construction and marking of compressed gas cylinders and pressure vessels are referenced. Compressed gases used in welding and cutting, cryogenic liquids and liquefied petroleum gases are also regulated under Chapters 35, 55 and 61, respectively. Compressed gases that are classified as hazardous materials are also regulated in Chapter 50, which includes general requirements. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5302 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 54 Corrosive Materials. Chapter 54 addresses the hazards of corrosive materials that have a destructive effect on living tissues. Although corrosive gases exist, most corrosive materials are solid or liquid and classified as either acids or bases (alkalis). These materials may pose a wide range of hazards other than corrosivity, such as combustibility, reactivity or oxidizing hazards, and must conform to the requirements of this code with respect to all known hazards. The focus of this chapter is on materials whose primary hazard is corrosivity; that is, the ability to destroy or irreparably damage living tissue on contact. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5402 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 55 Cryogenic Fluids. This chapter regulates the hazards associated with the storage, use and handling of cryogenic fluids through regulation of such things as pressure relief mechanisms and proper container storage. These hazards are in addition to the code requirements that address the other hazards of cryogenic fluids such as flammability and toxicity. These other characteristics are dealt with in Chapter 50 and other chapters, such as Chapter 58 dealing with flammable gases. Cryogens are hazardous because they are held at extremely low temperatures and high pressures. Many cryogenic fluids, however, are actually inert gases and would not be regulated elsewhere in this code. Cryogens are used for many applications but specifically have had widespread use in the biomedical field and in space programs. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5502 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 56 Explosives and Fireworks. This chapter prescribes minimum requirements for the safe manufacture, storage, handling and use of explosives, ammunition and blasting agents for commercial and industrial occupancies. These provisions are intended to protect the general public, emergency responders and individuals who handle explosives. Chapter 56 also regulates the manufacturing, retail sale, display and wholesale distribution of fireworks, establishing the requirements for obtaining approval to manufacture, store, sell, discharge or conduct a public display, and references national standards for regulations governing manufacture, storage and public displays. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5602 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 57 Flammable and Combustible Liquids. The requirements of this chapter are intended to reduce the likelihood of fires involving the storage, handling, use or transportation of flammable and combustible liquids. Adherence to these practices may also limit damage in the event of an accidental fire involving these materials. These liquids are used for fuel, lubricants, cleaners, solvents, medicine and even drinking. The danger associated with flammable and combustible liquids is that the vapors from these liquids, when combined with air in their flammable range, will burn or explode at temperatures near normal living and working environment. The protection provided by this code is to prevent the flammable and combustible liquids from being ignited. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5702 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 58 Flammable Gases and Flammable Cryogenic Fluids. Chapter 58 sets requirements for the storage and use of flammable gases. For safety purposes, there is a limit on the quantities of flammable gas allowed per control area. Exceeding these limitations increases the possibility of damage to both property and individuals. The principal hazard posed by flammable gas is its ready ignitability, or even explosivity, when mixed with air in the proper proportions. Consequently, occupancies storing or handling large quantities of flammable gas are classified as Group H-2 (high hazard) by the International Building Code. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5802 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 59 Flammable Solids. This chapter addresses general requirements for storage and handling of flammable solids, especially magnesium; however, it is important to note that several other solid materials, primarily metals including, but not limited to, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, calcium, zinc, sodium, lithium, potassium, sodium/potassium alloys, uranium, thorium and plutonium, can be explosion hazards under the right conditions. Some of these metals are almost exclusively laboratory materials but because of where they are used, fire service personnel must be trained to handle emergency situations. Because uranium, thorium and plutonium are also radioactive materials, they present still more specialized problems for fire service personnel. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 5902 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 60 Highly Toxic and Toxic Materials. The main purpose of this chapter is to protect occupants, emergency responders and those in the immediate area of the building and facility from short-term, acute hazards associated with a release or general exposure to toxic and highly toxic materials. This chapter deals with all three states of toxic and highly toxic materials: solids, liquids and gases. This code does not address long-term exposure effects of these materials, which are addressed by agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 6002 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 61 Liquefied Petroleum Gases. Chapter 61 establishes requirements for the safe handling, storing and use of LP-gas to reduce the possibility of damage to containers, accidental releases of LP-gas and exposure of flammable concentrations of LP-gas to ignition sources. LP-gas (notably propane) is well known as a camping fuel for cooking, lighting, heating and refrigerating and also remains a popular standby fuel supply for auxiliary generators as well as being widely used as an alternative motor vehicle fuel. Its characteristic as a clean-burning fuel has resulted in the addition of propane dispensers to service stations throughout the country. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 6102 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 62 Organic Peroxides. This chapter addresses the hazards associated with the storage, handling and use of organic peroxides and intends to manage the fire and oxidation hazards of organic peroxides by preventing their uncontrolled release. These chemicals possess the characteristics of flammable or combustible liquids and are also strong oxidizers. This unusual combination of properties requires special storage and handling precautions to prevent uncontrolled release, contamination, hazardous chemical reactions, fires or explosions. The requirements of this chapter pertain to industrial applications in which significant quantities of organic peroxides are stored or used; however, smaller quantities of organic peroxides still pose a significant hazard and, therefore, must be stored and used in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter and Chapter 50. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 6202 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 63 Oxidizers, Oxidizing Gases and Oxidizing Cryogenic Fluids. Chapter 63 addresses the hazards associated with solid, liquid, gaseous and cryogenic fluid oxidizing materials, including oxygen in home use, and establishes criteria for their safe storage and protection in indoor and outdoor storage facilities, minimizing the potential for uncontrolled releases and contact with fuel sources. Although oxidizers themselves do not burn, they pose unique fire hazards because of their ability to support combustion by breaking down and giving off oxygen. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 6302 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 64 Pyrophoric Materials. This chapter regulates the hazards associated with pyrophoric materials, which are capable of spontaneously igniting in the air at or below a temperature of 130°F (54°C). Many pyrophoric materials also pose severe flammability or reactivity hazards. This chapter addresses only the hazards associated with pyrophoric materials. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of the code with respect to all hazards. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 6402 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 65 Pyroxylin (Cellulose Nitrate) Plastics. This chapter addresses the significant hazards associated with pyroxylin (cellulose nitrate) plastics, which are the most dangerous and unstable of all plastic compounds. The chemically bound oxygen in their structure permits them to burn vigorously in the absence of atmospheric oxygen at a rate 15 times greater than comparable common combustibles. Strict compliance with the provisions of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping and storage arrangements, helps to reduce the hazards associated with pyroxylin (cellulose nitrate) plastics in a fire or other emergencies.

Chapter 66 Unstable (Reactive) Materials. This chapter addresses the hazards of unstable (reactive) liquid and solid materials as well as unstable (reactive) compressed gases. In addition to their unstable reactivity, these materials may pose other hazards, such as toxicity, corrosivity, explosivity, flammability or oxidizing potential. This chapter, however, intends to address those materials whose primary hazard is unstable reactivity. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of the code with respect to all hazards. Strict compliance with the provisions of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping and storage arrangements, help reduce the exposure hazards associated with unstable (reactive) materials in a fire or other emergency. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 6602 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapter 67 Water-reactive Solids and Liquids. This chapter addresses the hazards associated with water-reactive materials that are solid or liquid at normal temperatures and pressures. In addition to their water reactivity, these materials may pose a wide range of other hazards, such as toxicity, flammability, corrosiveness or oxidizing potential. This chapter addresses only those materials whose primary hazard is water reactivity. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of the code with respect to all hazards. Strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping and storage arrangements, helps to reduce the exposure hazards associated with water-reactive materials in a fire or other emergency. As with other chapters of the International Fire Code, Section 6702 contains a list of terms that are defined in Chapter 2 and are applicable to the chapter contents.

Chapters 68 through 79. Reserved for future use.

PART VI–REFERENCED STANDARDS

Chapter 80 Referenced Standards. This code contains several references to standards that are used to regulate materials and methods of construction. Chapter 80 contains a comprehensive list of all standards that are referenced in this code. The standards are part of the code to the extent of the reference to the standard (see Section 102.7). Compliance with the referenced standard is necessary for compliance with this code. By providing specifically adopted standards, the construction and installation requirements necessary for compliance with this code can be readily determined. The basis for code compliance is, therefore, established and available on an equal basis to the code official, contractor, designer and owner.

Chapter 80 is organized in a manner that makes it easy to locate specific standards. It lists all of the referenced standards alphabetically by acronym of the promulgating agency of the standard. Each agency’s standards are then listed in either alphabetical or numeric order based upon the standard identification. The list also contains the title of the standard; the edition (date) of the standard referenced; any addenda included as part of the ICC adoption; and the section or sections of this code that reference the standard.

PART VII–APPENDICES

Appendix A Board of Appeals. This appendix contains optional criteria that, when adopted, provide jurisdictions with detailed appeals, board member qualifications and administrative procedures to supplement the basic requirements found in Section 108 of this code. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix B Fire-flow Requirements for Buildings. This appendix provides a tool for the use of jurisdictions in establishing a policy for determining fire-flow requirements in accordance with Section 507.3. The determination of required fire flow is not an exact science, but having some level of information provides a consistent way of choosing the appropriate fire flow for buildings throughout a jurisdiction. The primary tool used in this appendix is a table that presents fire flow based on construction type and building area based on the correlation of the Insurance Services Office (ISO) method and the construction types used in the International Building Code. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix C Fire Hydrant Locations and Distribution. This appendix focuses on the location and spacing of fire hydrants, which is important to the success of fire-fighting operations. The difficulty with determining the spacing of fire hydrants is that every situation is unique and has unique challenges. Finding one methodology for determining hydrant spacing is difficult. This particular appendix gives one methodology based on the required fire flow that fire departments can work with to set a policy for hydrant distribution around new buildings and facilities in conjunction with Section 507.5. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix D Fire Apparatus Access Roads. This appendix contains more detailed elements for use with the basic access requirements found in Section 503, which gives some minimum criteria, such as a maximum length of 150 feet and a minimum width of 20 feet, but in many cases does not state specific criteria. This appendix, like Appendices B and C, is a tool for jurisdictions looking for guidance in establishing access requirements and includes criteria for multiple-family residential developments, large one- and two-family subdivisions, specific examples for various types of turnarounds for fire department apparatus and parking regulatory signage. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix E Hazard Categories. This appendix contains guidance for designers, engineers, architects, code officials, plans reviewers and inspectors in the classifying of hazardous materials so that proposed designs can be evaluated intelligently and accurately. The descriptive materials and explanations of hazardous materials and how to report and evaluate them on a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) are intended to be instructional as well as informative. Note that this appendix is for information purposes and is not intended for adoption.

Appendix F Hazard Ranking. The information in this appendix is intended to be a companion to the specific requirements of Chapters 51 through 67, which regulate the storage, handling and use of all hazardous materials classified as either physical or health hazards. These materials pose diverse hazards, including instability, reactivity, flammability, oxidizing potential or toxicity; therefore, identifying them by hazard ranking is essential. This appendix lists the various hazardous materials categories that are defined in this code, along with the NFPA 704 hazard ranking for each. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix G Cryogenic Fluids—Weight and Volume Equivalents. This appendix gives the fire code official and design professional a ready reference tool for the conversion of the liquid weight and volume of cryogenic fluid to their corresponding volume of gas and vice versa and is a companion to the provisions of Chapter 55 of this code. Note that this appendix is for information purposes and is not intended for adoption.

Appendix H Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) and Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement (HMIS) Instructions. This appendix is intended to assist businesses in establishing a Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) and Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement (HMIS) based on the classification and quantities of materials that would be found on-site, in storage or in use. The sample forms and available Safety Data Sheets (SDS) provide the basis for the evaluations. It is also a companion to IFC Sections 407.5 and 407.6, which provide the requirement that the HMIS and HMMP be submitted when required by the fire code official. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix I Fire Protection Systems—Noncompliant Conditions. The purpose of this appendix, which was developed by the ICC Hazard Abatement in Existing Buildings Committee, is to provide the fire code official with a list of conditions that are readily identifiable by the inspector during the course of an inspection utilizing the International Fire Code. The specific conditions identified in this appendix are primarily derived from applicable NFPA standards and pose a hazard to the proper operation of the respective systems. While these do not represent all of the conditions that pose a hazard or otherwise may impair the proper operation of fire protection systems, their identification in this adoptable appendix will provide a more direct path for enforcement by the fire code official. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix J Building Information Sign. This appendix provides design, installation and maintenance requirements for a Building Information Sign (BIS), a fire service tool to be utilized in the crucial, initial response of fire fighters to a structure fire. The BIS placard is designed to be utilized within the initial response time frame of an incident to assist fire fighters in their tactical size-up of a situation as soon as possible after arrival on the scene of a fire emergency. The BIS design is in the shape of a fire service Maltese Cross and includes five spaces (the four wings plus the centerpiece of the cross symbol) in which information is placed about the tactical considerations of construction type and hourly rating, fire protection systems, occupancy type, content hazards and special features that could affect tactical decisions and operations. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix K Construction Requirements for Existing Ambulatory Care Facilities. This appendix was created by the ICC Ad Hoc Committee on Healthcare (AHC) and its intent is to provide jurisdictions with an option for assessing minimum fire and life safety requirements for buildings containing ambulatory care facilities. While this appendix is written with the intent to apply retroactive minimum standards, the AHC recognized that the ambulatory care requirements are relatively recent additions to the International Building Code. For that reason, these requirements are presented as an appendix so that the adopting authority can exercise judgment in the adoption and application of this section. This appendix would also be useful for those local and state jurisdictions that are specifically focused on ensuring the safety for existing ambulatory care facilities by providing minimum criteria that could be used to bring older facilities into compliance with the current standards at the discretion of the adopting jurisdiction. The technical requirements are based on the current IBC language, which is consistent with the overall concept of the current federal requirements. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix L Requirements for Fire Fighter Air Replenishment Systems. This appendix provides for the design, installation and maintenance of permanently installed fire fighter breathing air systems in buildings designated by the jurisdiction. Breathing air is critical for fire-fighting operations. Historically, fire departments have supplied air bottles by means of a “bottle brigade,” whereby fire fighters manually transport air bottles up stairways, which is an extraordinarily fire fighter-intensive process and takes fire fighters away from their primary mission of rescue and fire fighting. Technology now exists to address the issue using in-building air supply systems. Fire fighter breathing air systems were introduced in the late 1980s and are now required in a number of communities throughout the United States. The system has been called a “standpipe for air” and consists of stainless steel, high-pressure piping that is supplied by on-site air storage or fire department air supply units. Air filling stations are then strategically located throughout the building allowing fire fighters to refill breathing air cylinders inside the fire building, negating the required “bottle brigade,” and making more fire fighters available for search, rescue and fire suppression operations. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix M High-rise Buildings—Retroactive Automatic Sprinkler Requirement. This appendix was created with the intent to provide an option for adoption by jurisdictions that choose to require existing high-rise buildings to be retrofitted with automatic sprinklers. Modern fire and building codes require complete automatic fire sprinkler protection and a variety of other safety features in new high-rise construction. Many older high-rise buildings lack automatic sprinkler protection and other basic fire protection features necessary to protect the occupants, emergency responders and the structure itself. Without complete automatic sprinkler protection, fire departments cannot provide the level of protection that high-rise buildings demand. Existing high-rise buildings that are not protected with automatic sprinklers represent a significant hazard to occupants and fire fighters, and can significantly impact a community’s infrastructure and economic viability in the event of a fire loss. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix N Indoor Trade Shows and Exhibitions. This appendix was created to address the hazards that are associated with larger, more complex trade shows and exhibitions. Although many of these requirements are already included in various locations in this code, some of the more important items, such as requirements for covered booths and multiple-story booths, are not. The intent is to have the requirements covering these events in a single location. The provisions are essentially a series of pointers to other locations within this code. This assists those organizing exhibitions and individual exhibitors unfamiliar with the fire code. The appendix can be adopted by jurisdictions looking for specific regulations on this subject or used as a guide where it is not. Note that the provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

Appendix O Fires or Barbecues on Balconies or Patios. This optional appendix has requirements for grills or any other open flame on balconies or patios of apartment buildings containing three or more dwelling units.

Appendix P Emergency Responder Radio Coverage. This optional appendix has requirements for emergency responder radio coverage in new and existing buildings. This was part of the model code, but moved to an optional appendix for communities to adopt as is or as the basis for their own rules.

CHAPTER 1
SCOPE AND ADMINISTRATION

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of the code and describes how the code is to be applied and enforced. Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—General Provisions (Sections 101–102) and Part 2—Administrative Provisions (Sections 103–113). Section 101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes as applicable.

This code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document, and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property owner.

Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to adopt uniform fire safety standards consistent with nationally recognized good practice for the safeguarding to a reasonable degree of life and property from the hazards of fire and explosion arising from the storage, handling and use of hazardous substances, materials and devices, and from conditions hazardous to life or property in the use or occupancy of buildings or premises.

Scope. The scope of this chapter is intended to be consistent with Minnesota Statutes, Section 299F.011.

Codes and Standards incorporated by reference.

A dry standpipe system that is arranged through the use of a device, such as a deluge valve, to admit water into the system piping upon activation of a remote control device located at a hose connection. A remote control activation device shall be provided at each hose connection. The water supply for a semiautomatic dry standpipe system shall be capable of supplying the system demand.

STANDPIPE SYSTEM, CLASSES OF. “Classes of standpipe system” means the following:

Class I system. “Class I system” means a system providing 21/2 inch (64 mm) and 11/2 inch (38 mm) hose connections to supply water for use by fire departments and those trained in handling heavy fire streams.

Class II system. “Class II system” means a system providing 11/2 inch (38 mm) hose stations to supply water for use primarily by the building occupants or by the fire department during initial response.

The definition for the classes of standpipe systems has been modified by adding a 11/2 inch hose connection to the definition of Class I and deleting entirely the definition for Class III. Both 21/2 inch and 11/2 inch connections on a Class I system can be achieved by installing a 11/2 inch reducer on the 21/2 inch outlet. This modification coordinates with state amendments to Section 905 which eliminate any requirement for a Class III system.

CHAPTER 4
EMERGENCY PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 4 addresses the human contribution to life safety in buildings when a fire or other emergency occurs. The requirements for continuous training and scheduled fire, evacuation and lockdown drills can be as important as the required periodic inspections and maintenance of built-in fire protection features. The level of preparation by the occupants also improves the emergency responders’ abilities during an emergency. The International Building Code® focuses on built-in fire protection features, such as automatic sprinkler systems, fireresistance-rated construction and properly designed egress systems, whereas this chapter fully addresses the human element.

CHAPTER 9
FIRE PROTECTION AND LIFE SAFETY SYSTEMS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active fire protection equipment systems to perform the functions of detecting a fire, alerting the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency, mass notification, gas detection, controlling smoke and controlling or extinguishing the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building, because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of the International Building Code®; however, this chapter also contains periodic testing criteria that are not contained in the International Building Code. In addition, the special fire protection systemrequirements based on use and occupancy found in Chapter 4 of the International Building Code are duplicated in this chapter as a user convenience.

CHAPTER 10
MEANS OF EGRESS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing the means of egress established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. This chapter addresses all portions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified.

The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Sections 1003 through 1030 are duplicated text from Chapter 10 of the International Building Code®; however, the International Fire Code® contains an additional Section 1031 on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings. Retroactive minimum means of egress requirements for existing buildings are found in Chapter 11.

SECTION 1001
ADMINISTRATION
1001.1 General.

Buildings or portions thereof shall be provided with a means of egress system as required by this chapter. The provisions of this chapter shall control the design, construction, and arrangement of means of egress components required to provide an approved means of egress from structures and portions thereof. Sections 1003 through 1031 shall apply to new construction. Sections 1001, 1002, 1031, and 1104 shall apply to existing buildings.

1001.1.1 Compliance options.

Means of egress installed and maintained in accordance with the Minnesota Residential Code or Minnesota Building Code, when applicable, shall be deemed to comply with this chapter.

[BE] 1001.2 Minimum requirements.

It shall be unlawful to alter a building or structure in a manner that will reduce the number of exits or the capacity of the means of egress to less than required by this code.

1001.3 Special exiting provisions for younger students.

Rooms in Group E occupancies used by preschool, kindergarten, first- or second-grade pupils, latchkey, child care, early childhood family education, teen parent, or similar programs shall be located as required by the Building Code.

Younger children are required to be located as close to ground level (i.e., first story) as possible to minimize the number of steps that need to be traveled to exit the building. Rooms used by these younger children are allowed to be above or below the first story if other egress and/or fire protection features are provided. See Minnesota Statutes, section 123B.51, subdivision 7.

[BE] 1005.3.1 Stairways.

The capacity, in inches, of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairways by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.3 inch (7.6 mm) per occupant. Where stairways serve more than one story, only the occupant load of each story considered individually shall be used in calculating the required capacity of the stairways serving that story.

Exceptions:

1.	For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches, of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairways by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inches (5.1 mm) per occupant in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 and an emergency voice/alarm communication system in accordance with Section 907.5.2.2.

2.	Facilities with smoke-protected assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in Table 1029.6.2 indicated for stepped aisles for exit access or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is provided with a smoke control system complying with Section 909.

3.	Facilities with open-air assembly seating shall be permitted to the capacity factors in Section 1029.6.3 indicated for stepped aisles for exit access or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is open to the outdoors.

[BE] 1005.3.2 Other egress components.

The capacity, in inches, of means of egress components other than stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such component by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inches (5.1 mm) per occupant.

Exceptions:

1.	For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches, of means of egress components other than stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such component by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.15 inches (3.8 mm) per occupant in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 and an emergency voice/alarm communication system in accordance with Section 907.5.2.2.

2.	Facilities with smoke-protected assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in Table 1029.6.2 indicated for level or ramped aisles for means of egress components other than stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is provided with a smoke control system complying with Section 909.

3.	Facilities with open-air assembly seating shall be permitted to the capacity factors in Section 1029.6.3 indicated for level or ramped aisles for means of egress components other than stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is open to the outdoors.

[BE] 1005.4 Continuity.

The minimum width or required capacity of the means of egress required from any story of a building shall not be reduced along the path of egress travel until arrival at the public way.

[BE] 1005.5 Distribution of minimum width and required capacity.

Where more than one exit, or access to more than one exit, is required, the means of egress shall be configured such that the loss of any one exit, or access to one exit, shall not reduce the available capacity or width to less than 50 percent of the required capacity or width.

[BE] 1005.6 Egress convergence.

Where the means of egress from stories above and below converge at an intermediate level, the capacity of the means of egress from the point of convergence shall be not less than the largest minimum width or the sum of the required capacities for the stairways or ramps serving the two adjacent stories, whichever is larger.

[BE] 1005.7 Encroachment.

Encroachments into the required means of egress width shall be in accordance with the provisions of this section.

[BE] 1005.7.1 Doors.

Doors, when fully opened, shall not reduce the required width by more than 7 inches (178 mm). Doors in any position shall not reduce the required width by more than one-half.

Exceptions:

1.	Surface-mounted latch release hardware shall be exempt from inclusion in the 7-inch maximum (178 mm) encroachment where both of the following conditions exists:

STANDARD FOR BLEACHERS, FOLDING AND
TELESCOPIC SEATING, AND GRANDSTANDS
American
National
Standard

Approval of an American National Standard requires verification by ANSI that the requirements for due process, consensus and other criteria for approval established by the standard developer are consistent with the ANSI Essential Requirements.

Consensus is established when, in the judgement of the ANSI Board of Standards Review, substantial agreement has been reached by directly and materially affected interests. Substantial agreement means much more than a simple majority, but not necessarily unanimity. Consensus requires that all views and objections be considered, and that a concerted effort be made toward their resolution.

The use of American National Standards is completely voluntary; their existence does not in any respect preclude anyone, whether he or she has approved the standards or not, from manufacturing, marketing, purchasing, or using products, processes or procedures not conforming to the standards, unless compliance with the standard is required by law instituted by a governmental body.

The American National Standards Institute does not develop standards and will in no circumstances give an interpretation of any American National Standard. Moreover, no person shall have the right or authority to issue an interpretation of an American National Standard in the name of the American National Standards Institute. Requests for interpretations should be addressed to the secretariat or sponsor whose name appears on the title page of this standard.

CAUTION NOTICE: This American National Standard may be revised or withdrawn at any time. The procedures of the American National Standards Institute require that action be taken periodically to reaffirm, revise, or withdraw this standard. Purchasers of American National Standards may receive current information on all standards by calling or writing the American National Standards Institute.

FOREWORD
Introduction

In March 2000 the ICC Board of Directors, responding to a need highlighted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) Roundtable in December 1999 on Bleachers and Grandstands, appointed a consensus committee to develop a standard to cover new and existing installations of all types of bleachers and bleacher-type seating, including fixed and folding bleachers intended for indoor, outdoor, temporary and permanent use. This followed the submission of a bill to the U.S. House of Representatives entitled the Bleacher Safety Act of 1999 (H.R. 836), which authorized the CPSC to issue a standard for bleacher safety.

Development

ICC 300—2017 has been developed utilizing a consensus process under the provisions of the ICC Consensus Procedures. The ICC Consensus Committee on Bleacher Safety (IS-BLE) was established. The meetings of the IS-BLE Consensus Committee were open to the public. Interested individuals and organizations from across the country participated. Views and objections were solicited through public proposal and comment periods. All views and objections were considered by the consensus committee and an effort was made toward their resolution. A vote by the consensus committee approved this publication.

The requirements in ICC 300—2017 are based on the intent to establish: provisions consistent with the scope of the ICC family of codes and standards that adequately protect public health, safety and welfare; provisions that do not necessarily increase construction costs; provisions that do not restrict the use of new materials, products or methods of construction; and, provisions that do not give preferential treatment to particular types or classes of materials, products or methods of construction.

Adoption

The ICC 300—2017 edition will be made available for adoption and use by jurisdictions internationally. Its use within a governmental jurisdiction is intended to be accomplished through adoption by reference in accordance with proceedings establishing the jurisdiction’s laws.

International Code Council Consensus Committee on Bleacher Safety (IS-BLE)

Consensus Committee SCOPE: The ICC Consensus Committee on Bleacher Safety (IS-BLE) shall have primary responsibility for safety provisions for new and existing installations of all types of bleachers and bleacher-type seating, including fixed and folding bleachers intended for indoor, outdoor, temporary and permanent use.

This standard was processed and approved for submittal to ANSI by the ICC Consensus Committee on Bleacher Safety (ISBLE). Committee approval of the standard does not necessarily imply that all committee members voted for its approval.

Representatives on the Consensus Committee are classified in one of three voting interest categories. The committee has been formed in order to achieve consensus as required by ANSI Essential Requirements.

COMMODITY CLASSIFICATION
3203.1 Classification of commodities.

Commodities shall be classified as Class I, II, III, IV or high hazard in accordance with Sections 3203.2 through 3203.10.3. Materials listed within each commodity classification are assumed to be unmodified for improved combustibility characteristics. Use of flame-retarding modifiers or the physical form of the material could change the classification.

3203.2 Class I commodities.

Class I commodities are noncombustible products in ordinary corrugated cartons with or without single-thickness dividers, or in ordinary paper wrappings with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.

3203.3 Class II commodities.

Class II commodities are Class I products in slatted wooden crates, solid wooden boxes, multiple-thickness paperboard cartons or equivalent combustible packaging material with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.

3203.4 Class III commodities.

Class III commodities are products of wood, paper, natural fiber cloth, or Group C plastics or products thereof, with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.

3203.5 Class IV commodities.

Class IV commodities are Class I, II or III products containing Group A plastics in ordinary corrugated cartons; Class I, II and III products with Group A plastic packaging; Group B plastics; and free-flowing Group A plastics with or without wood pallets. The total amount of nonfree-flowing Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.

3203.6 High-hazard commodities.

High-hazard commodities are products presenting special fire hazards beyond those of Class I, II, III or IV. Group A plastics not otherwise classified are included in this class.

3203.7 Classification of plastics.

Plastics shall be designated as Group A, B or C in accordance with Sections 3203.7.1 through 3203.7.3.

3203.7.1 Group A plastics.

Group A plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion that is much higher than that of ordinary combustibles, and a burning rate higher than that of Group B plastics.

3203.7.2 Group B plastics.

Group B plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion and a burning rate higher than that of ordinary combustibles, but not as high as those of Group A plastics.

3203.7.3 Group C plastics.

Group C plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion and a burning rate similar to those of ordinary combustibles.

3203.8 Examples of commodity classification.

Table 3203.8 shall be used to determine the commodity classification for various products and materials. Products not found in the list shall be classified based on the classification descriptions in Sections 3203.2 through 3203.6 and the products they most nearly represent in Table 3203.8. Table 3203.8 considers the product and the packaging if listed with the item. Products with additional packaging consisting of Group A plastics shall be classified in accordance with Section 3203.9.

The commodity classifications are based on products with, or without, wood pallets. Where plastic pallets are used, the commodity classification shall be modified in accordance with Section 3203.10.

CHAPTER 38
HIGHER EDUCATION LABORATORIES

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 38 is a new chapter addressing the unique needs of laboratories in higher education institutions. These academic institutions often have chemistry, biology, medical, engineering and other laboratories where hazardous materials are used. This chapter addresses both new and existing buildings and new and existing laboratories. Applying the general hazardous material provisions has been difficult because of the way these laboratories operate. Often there are many small laboratories with very small quantities of hazardous materials that individually do not exceed the maximum allowable quantities (MAQs). In aggregate, the quantities will exceed the MAQs and could result in the need for a Group H occupancy classification. However, it is believed that the lower density of hazardous materials often mitigates the overall risk. Therefore, this lower density along with a package of additional requirements, including the concept of laboratory suites, are appropriate to allow the laboratories to not be classified as Group H. This chapter also addresses the use of certain materials typically prohibited for existing buildings not protected throughout with a sprinkler system. These allowances come with certain safety measures such as the use of storage cabinets and fume hoods. Note that Section 428 of the International Building Code®addresses the construction requirements found in this chapter for laboratory suites.

CRYOGENIC FLUIDS

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 55 regulates the hazards associated with the storage, use and handling of cryogenic fluids through regulation of such things as pressure relief mechanisms and proper container storage. These hazards are in addition to the code requirements that address the other hazards of cryogenic fluids such as flammability and toxicity. These other characteristics are dealt with in Chapter 50 and other chapters, such as Chapter 58 and its content about flammable gases. Cryogens are hazardous because they are held at extremely low temperatures and high pressures. Many cryogenic fluids, however, are actually inert gases and would not be regulated elsewhere in this code. Cryogens are used for many applications but specifically have had widespread use in the biomedical field and in space programs.

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 57 provides requirements that are intended to reduce the likelihood of fires involving the storage, handling, use or transportation of flammable and combustible liquids. Adherence to these practices may also limit damage in the event of an accidental fire involving these materials. These liquids are used for fuel, lubricants, cleaners, solvents, medicine and even drinking. The danger associated with flammable and combustible liquids is that the vapors from these liquids, when combined with air in their flammable range, will burn or explode at temperatures near normal living and working environments. The regulations herein are intended to prevent the flammable and combustible liquids from being ignited and provide mitigating requirements for when a fire does occur.

SECTION 5701
GENERAL
5701.1 Scope and application.

APPENDIX B
FIRE-FLOW REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDINGS

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix B provides a tool for the use of jurisdictions in establishing a policy for determining fire-flow requirements in accordance with Section 507.3. The determination of required fire flow is not an exact science, but having some level of information provides a consistent way of choosing the appropriate fire flow for buildings throughout a jurisdiction. The primary tool used in this appendix is a table that presents fire flow based on construction type and building area based on the correlation of the Insurance Services Office (ISO) method and the construction types used in the International Building Code®.

SECTION B101
GENERAL
B101.1 Scope.

The procedure for determining fire-flow requirements for buildings or portions of buildings hereafter constructed shall be in accordance with this appendix. This appendix does not apply to structures other than buildings.

SECTION B102
DEFINITIONS
B102.1 Definitions.

For the purpose of this appendix, certain terms are defined as follows:

FIRE FLOW. The flow rate of a water supply, measured at 20 pounds per square inch (psi) (138 kPa) residual pressure, that is available for fire fighting.

FIRE-FLOW CALCULATION AREA. The floor area, in square feet (m2), used to determine the required fire flow.

SECTION B103
MODIFICATIONS
B103.1 Decreases.

The fire code official is authorized to reduce the fire-flow requirements for isolated buildings or a group of buildings in rural areas or small communities where the development of full fire-flow requirements is impractical.

B103.2 Increases.

The fire code official is authorized to increase the fire-flow requirements where conditions indicate an unusual susceptibility to group fires or conflagrations. An increase shall be not more than twice that required for the building under consideration.

B103.3 Areas without water supply systems.

For information regarding water supplies for fire-fighting purposes in rural and suburban areas in which adequate and reliable water supply systems do not exist, the fire code official is authorized to utilize NFPA 1142 or the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code.

SECTION B104
FIRE-FLOW CALCULATION AREA
B104.1 General.

The fire-flow calculation area shall be the total floor area of all floor levels within the exterior walls, and under the horizontal projections of the roof of a building, except as modified in Section B104.3.

B104.2 Area separation.

Portions of buildings that are separated by fire walls without openings, constructed in accordance with the International Building Code, are allowed to be considered as separate fire-flow calculation areas.

B104.3 Type IA and Type IB construction.

The fire-flow calculation area of buildings constructed of Type IA and Type IB construction shall be the area of the three largest successive floors.

Exception: Fire-flow calculation area for open parking garages shall be determined by the area of the largest floor.

SECTION B105

a.	Reduce by 100 feet for dead-end streets or roads.

b.	Where streets are provided with median dividers that cannot be crossed by fire fighters pulling hose lines, or where arterial streets are provided with four or more traffic lanes and have a traffic count of more than 30,000 vehicles per day, hydrant spacing shall average 500 feet on each side of the street and be arranged on an alternating basis.

c.	Where new water mains are extended along streets where hydrants are not needed for protection of structures or similar fire problems, fire hydrants shall be provided at spacing not to exceed 1,000 feet to provide for transportation hazards.

d.	Reduce by 50 feet for dead-end streets or roads.

e.	One hydrant for each 1,000 gallons per minute or fraction thereof.

f.	A 50-percent spacing increase shall be permitted where the building is equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 of the International Fire Code.

g.	A 25-percent spacing increase shall be permitted where the building is equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.2 or 903.3.1.3 of the International Fire Code or Section P2904 of the International Residential Code.

h.	The fire code official is authorized to modify the location, number and distribution of fire hydrants based on site-specific constraints and hazards.

SECTION C103
FIRE HYDRANT SPACING
C103.1 Hydrant spacing.

Fire apparatus access roads and public streets providing required access to buildings in accordance with Section 503 shall be provided with one or more fire hydrants, as determined by Section C102.1. Where more than one fire hydrant is required, the distance between required fire hydrants shall be in accordance with Sections C103.2 and C103.3.

C103.2 Average spacing.

The average spacing between fire hydrants shall be in accordance with Table C102.1.

Exception: The average spacing shall be permitted to be increased by 10 percent where existing fire hydrants provide all or a portion of the required number of fire hydrants.

C103.3 Maximum spacing.

The maximum spacing between fire hydrants shall be in accordance with Table C102.1.

SECTION C104
CONSIDERATION OF EXISTING FIRE HYDRANTS
C104.1 Existing fire hydrants.

Existing fire hydrants on public streets are allowed to be considered as available to meet the requirements of Sections C102 and C103. Existing fire hydrants on adjacent properties are allowed to be considered as available to meet the requirements of Sections C102 and C103 provided that a fire apparatus access road extends between properties and that an easement is established to prevent obstruction of such roads.

APPENDIX E
HAZARD CATEGORIES

This appendix is for information purposes and is not intended for adoption.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix E contains guidance for designers, engineers, architects, code officials, plans reviewers and inspectors in the classifying of hazardous materials so that proposed designs can be evaluated intelligently and accurately. The descriptive materials and explanations of hazardous materials and how to report and evaluate them on a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) are intended to be instructional as well as informative. Note that Safety Data Sheets also include the concept known as Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).

SECTION E101
GENERAL
E101.1 Scope.

This appendix provides information, explanations and examples to illustrate and clarify the hazard categories contained in Chapter 50 of the International Fire Code. The hazard categories are based on the DOL 29 CFR. Where numerical classifications are included, they are in accordance with nationally recognized standards.

This appendix should not be used as the sole means of hazardous materials classification.

SECTION E102
HAZARD CATEGORIES
E102.1 Physical hazards.

Materials classified in this section pose a physical hazard.

E102.1.1 Explosives and blasting agents.

The current UN/DOT classification system recognized by international authorities, the Department of Defense and others classifies all explosives as Class 1 materials. They are then divided into six separate divisions to indicate their relative hazard. There is not a direct correlation between the designations used by the old DOT system and those used by the current system nor is there correlation with the system (high and low) established by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF). Table 5604.3 provides some guidance with regard to the current categories and their relationship to the old categories. Some items appear in more than one division, depending on factors such as the degree of confinement or separation, by type of packaging, storage configuration or state of assembly.

In order to determine the level of hazard presented by explosive materials, testing to establish quantitatively their explosive nature is required. There are numerous test methods that have been used to establish the character of an explosive material. Standardized tests, required for finished goods containing explosives or explosive materials in a packaged form suitable for shipment or storage, have been established by UN/DOT and BATF. However, these tests do not consider key elements that should be examined in a manufacturing situation. In manufacturing operations, the condition and/or the state of a material may vary within the process. Potentially, material classification and the requirements used to determine that classification during manufacturing will differ from the classification of the same material found in finished goods. A classification methodology must be used that recognizes the hazards commensurate with the application to the variable physical conditions as well as potential variations of physical character and type of explosive under consideration.

Test methods or guidelines for hazard classification of energetic materials used for in-process operations shall be approved by the fire code official. Test methods used shall be DOD, BATF, UN/DOT or other approved criteria. The results of such testing shall become a portion of the files of the jurisdiction and be included as an independent section of any Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) required by Section 5605.2.1. Also see Section 104.7.2.

Examples of materials in various Divisions are as follows:

1.	Division 1.1 (High Explosives). Consists of explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is one that affects almost the entire pile of material instantaneously. Includes substances that, where tested in accordance with approved methods, can be caused to detonate by means of a blasting cap where unconfined or will transition from deflagration to a detonation where confined or unconfined. Examples: dynamite, TNT, nitroglycerine, C-3, HMX, RDX, encased explosives, military ammunition.

2.	Division 1.2 (Low Explosives). Consists of explosives that have a projection hazard, but not a mass explosion hazard. Examples: nondetonating encased explosives, military ammunition and the like.

3.	Division 1.3 (Low Explosives). Consists of explosives that have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard. The major hazard is radiant heat or violent burning, or both. Can be deflagrated where confined. Examples: smokeless powder, propellant explosives, display fireworks.

4.	Division 1.4. Consists of explosives that pose a minor explosion hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is expected. An internal fire must not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package. Examples: squibs (nondetonating igniters), explosive actuators, explosive trains (low-level detonating cord).

5.	Division 1.5 (Blasting Agents). Consists of very insensitive explosives. This division comprises substances that have a mass explosion hazard, but are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of transport. Materials are not cap sensitive; however, they are mass detonating where provided with sufficient input. Examples: oxidizer and liquid fuel slurry mixtures and gels, ammonium nitrate combined with fuel oil.

6.	Division 1.6. Consists of extremely insensitive articles that do not have a mass explosive hazard. This division comprises articles that contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances and that demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation. Although this category of materials has been defined, the primary application is currently limited to military uses. Examples: Low vulnerability military weapons.

Explosives in each division are assigned a compatibility group letter by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety (DOT) based on criteria specified by DOTn 49 CFR. Compatibility group letters are used to specify the controls for the transportation and storage related to various materials to prevent an increase in hazard that might result if certain types of explosives were stored or transported together. Altogether, there are 35 possible classification codes for explosives, for example, 1.1A, 1.3C, 1.4S.

E102.1.2 Compressed gases.

Examples include:

1.	Flammable: acetylene, carbon monoxide, ethane, ethylene, hydrogen, methane. Ammonia will ignite and burn although its flammable range is too narrow for it to fit the definition of “Flammable gas.”

For binary mixtures where the hazardous component is diluted with a nonflammable gas, the mixture shall be categorized in accordance with CGA P-23.

2.	Oxidizing: oxygen, ozone, oxides of nitrogen, chlorine and fluorine. Chlorine and fluorine do not contain oxygen but reaction with flammables is similar to that of oxygen.

3.	Corrosive: ammonia, hydrogen chloride, fluorine.

4.	Highly toxic: arsine, cyanogen, fluorine, germane, hydrogen cyanide, nitric oxide, phosphine, hydrogen selenide, stibine.

5.	Toxic: chlorine, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen sulfide, phosgene, silicon tetrafluoride.

6.	Inert (chemically unreactive): argon, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, xenon.

7.	Pyrophoric: diborane, dichloroborane, phosphine, silane.

8.	Unstable (reactive): butadiene (unstabilized), ethylene oxide, vinyl chloride.

E102.1.3 Flammable and combustible liquids.

Examples include:

1.	Flammable liquids.

Class IA liquids shall include those having flash points below 73°F (23°C) and having a boiling point at or below 100°F (38°C).

SECTION E103
EVALUATION OF HAZARDS
E103.1 Degree of hazard.

The degree of hazard present depends on many variables that should be considered individually and in combination. Some of these variables are as shown in Sections E103.1.1 through E103.1.5.

E103.1.1 Chemical properties of the material.

Chemical properties of the material determine self reactions and reactions that could occur with other materials. Generally, materials within subdivisions of hazard categories will exhibit similar chemical properties. However, materials with similar chemical properties could pose very different hazards. Each individual material should be researched to determine its hazardous properties and then considered in relation to other materials that it might contact and the surrounding environment.

E103.1.2 Physical properties of the material.

Physical properties, such as whether a material is a solid, liquid or gas at ordinary temperatures and pressures, considered along with chemical properties will determine requirements for containment of the material. Specific gravity (weight of a liquid compared to water) and vapor density (weight of a gas compared to air) are both physical properties that are important in evaluating the hazards of a material.

E103.1.3 Amount and concentration of the material.

The amount of material present and its concentration must be considered along with physical and chemical properties to determine the magnitude of the hazard. Hydrogen peroxide, for example, is used as an antiseptic and a hair bleach in low concentrations (approximately 8 percent in water solution). Over 8 percent, hydrogen peroxide is classed as an oxidizer and is toxic. Above 90 percent, it is a Class 4 oxidizer “that can undergo an explosive reaction when catalyzed or exposed to heat, shock or friction,” a definition that, incidentally, places hydrogen peroxide over 90-percent concentration in the unstable (reactive) category. Small amounts at high concentrations could present a greater hazard than large amounts at low concentrations.

E103.1.3.1 Mixtures.

Gases—toxic and highly toxic gases include those gases that have an LC50 of 2,000 parts per million (ppm) or less when rats are exposed for a period of 1 hour or less. To maintain consistency with the definitions for these materials, exposure data for periods other than 1 hour must be normalized to 1 hour. To classify mixtures of compressed gases that contain one or more toxic or highly toxic components, the LC50 of the mixture must be determined. Mixtures that contain only two components are binary mixtures. Those that contain more than two components are multicomponent mixtures. Where two or more hazardous substances (components) having an LC50 below 2,000 ppm are present in a mixture, their combined effect, rather than that of the individual substance components, must be considered. The effects of the hazards present must be considered as additive, except where there is a good reason to believe that the principal effects of the different harmful substances (components) are not additive.

For binary mixtures where the hazardous component is diluted with a nontoxic gas such as an inert gas, the LC50 of the mixture is estimated by use of the methodology contained in CGA P-20. The hazard zones specified in CGA P-20 are applicable for DOTn purposes and shall not be used for hazard classification.

E103.1.4 Actual use, activity or process involving the material.

The definition of handling, storage and use in closed systems refers to materials in packages or containers. Dispensing and use in open containers or systems describes situations where a material is exposed to ambient conditions or vapors are liberated to the atmosphere. Dispensing and use in open systems, then, are generally more hazardous situations than handling, storage or use in closed systems. The actual use or process could include heating, electric or other sparks, catalytic or reactive materials and many other factors that could affect the hazard and must therefore be thoroughly analyzed.

E103.1.5 Surrounding conditions.

Conditions such as other materials or processes in the area, type of construction of the structure, fire protection features (for example, fire walls, sprinkler systems, alarms), occupancy (use) of adjoining areas, normal temperatures, exposure to weather, etc., must be taken into account in evaluating the hazard.

E103.2 Evaluation questions.

The following are sample evaluation questions:

1.	What is the material? Correct identification is important; exact spelling is vital. Checking labels and SDS and asking responsible persons should be among the highest priorities.

2.	What are the concentration and strength?

3.	What is the physical form of the material? Liquids, gases and finely divided solids have differing requirements for spill and leak control and containment.

4.	How much material is present? Consider in relation to permit amounts, maximum allowable quantity per control area (from Group H occupancy requirements), amounts that require detached storage and overall magnitude of the hazard.

5.	What other materials (including furniture, equipment and building components) are close enough to interact with the material?

6.	What are the likely reactions?

7.	What is the activity involving the material?

8.	How does the activity impact the hazardous characteristics of the material? Consider vapors released or hazards otherwise exposed.

9.	What must the material be protected from? (For example, other materials, temperature, shock, pressure.)

10.	What effects of the material must people and the environment be protected from?

11.	How can protection be accomplished? Consider:

11.1.	Proper containers and equipment.

11.2.	Separation by distance or construction.

11.3.	Enclosure in cabinets or rooms.

11.4.	Spill control, drainage and containment.

11.5.	Control systems-ventilation, special electrical, detection and alarm, extinguishment, explosion venting, limit controls, exhaust scrubbers and excess flow control.

11.6.	Administrative (operational) controls-signs, ignition source control, security, personnel training, established procedures, storage plans and emergency plans.

Evaluation of the hazard is a strongly subjective process; therefore, the person charged with this responsibility must gather as much relevant data as possible so that the decision will be objective and within the limits prescribed in laws, policies and standards.

It could be necessary to cause the responsible persons in charge to have tests made by qualified persons or testing laboratories to support contentions that a particular material or process is or is not hazardous. See Section 104.7.2

APPENDIX F
HAZARD RANKING

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.

User note:

About this appendix: Appendix F is intended to be a companion to the specific requirements of Chapters 51 through 67, which regulate the storage, handling and use of all hazardous materials classified as either physical or health hazards. These materials pose diverse hazards, including instability, reactivity, flammability, oxidizing potential or toxicity; therefore, identifying them by hazard ranking is essential. This appendix lists the various hazardous material categories that are defined in this code, along with the NFPA 704 hazard ranking for each.

SECTION F101
GENERAL
F101.1 Scope.

Assignment of levels of hazards to be applied to specific hazard classes as required by NFPA 704 shall be in accordance with this appendix. The appendix is based on application of the degrees of hazard as defined in NFPA 704 arranged by hazard class as for specific categories defined in Chapter 2 of the International Fire Code and used throughout.

F101.2 General.

The hazard rankings shown in Table F101.2 have been established by using guidelines found within NFPA 704. As noted in Section 4.2 of NFPA 704, there could be specific reasons to alter the degree of hazard assigned to a specific material; for example, ignition temperature, flammable range or susceptibility of a container to rupture by an internal combustion explosion or to metal failure while under pressure or because of heat from external fire. As a result, the degree of hazard assigned for the same material can vary when assessed by different people of equal competence.

The hazard rankings assigned to each class represent reasonable minimum hazard levels for a given class based on the use of criteria established by NFPA 704. Specific cases of use or storage may dictate the use of higher degrees of hazard in certain cases.

a.	The values listed for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are “typical” values. LNG is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, and no two LNG streams have exactly the same composition.

G101.2.1 Use of the table.

To use Table G101.2, read horizontally across the line of interest. For example, to determine the number of cubic feet of gas contained in 1.0 gallon (3.785 L) of liquid argon, find 1.000 in the column entitled “Volume of Liquid at Normal Boiling Point.” Reading across the line under the column entitled “Volume of Gas at NTP” (70°F and 1 atmosphere/14.7 psia), the value of 112.45 cubic feet (3.184 m3) is found.

G101.2.2 Other quantities.

If other quantities are of interest, the numbers can be multiplied or divided to obtain the quantity of interest. For example, to determine the number of cubic feet of argon gas contained in a volume of 1,000 gallons (3785 L) of liquid argon at its normal boiling point, multiply 112.45 by 1,000 to obtain 112,450 cubic feet (3184 m3).

P104.2.6 Availability.

The in-building coverage system, in general, shall operate according to its intended specification with “5-9s” availability of 99.999 percent of each year; that is, no critical component of the system shall be out of normal operation for more than 5.26 minutes of each year.

P105 Installation requirements.

The installation of the public safety radio coverage system shall be in accordance with Sections P105.1 through P105.5.

P105.1 Approval prior to installation.

Amplification systems capable of operating on frequencies licensed to any public safety agency by the FCC shall not be installed without prior coordination and approval of the fire code official.

P105.2 Minimum qualifications of personnel.

The minimum qualifications of the system designer and lead installation personnel shall include at least one of the following:

1.	Certification of in-building system training issued by a nationally recognized organization or school.

2.	A certificate issued by the manufacturer of the equipment being installed.

These qualifications shall not be required where demonstration of adequate skills and experience satisfactory to the fire code official is provided.

P105.3 Acceptance test procedure.

When an emergency responder radio coverage system is required, and upon completion of installation, the building owner shall have the radio system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 95 percent. The test procedure shall be conducted as follows:

1.	Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of 20 approximately equal test areas.

2.	The test shall be conducted using a calibrated hand-held or hip-worn device of the latest brand and model used by the agency talking through the agency’s radio communications system.

3.	Failure of a maximum of two nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test.

4.	In the event that three of the test areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor shall be permitted to be divided into 40 equal test areas. Failure of a maximum of four nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test. If the system fails the 40-area test, the system shall be altered to meet the 95 percent coverage requirement.

5.	A test location approximately in the center of each test area shall be selected for the test, with the radio enabled to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the building through the public agency’s radio communications system. Once the test location has been selected, that location shall represent the entire test area. Failure in the selected test location shall be considered failure of that test area. Additional test locations shall not be permitted.

6.	The gain values of all amplifiers, if applicable, shall be measured, and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.

7.	As part of the installation, a spectrum analyzer or other suitable test equipment shall be utilized to ensure spurious oscillations are not being generated by the subject in-building coverage system. This test shall be conducted at time of installation and subsequent annual inspections.

8.	A test shall be considered a “failure” when a transmission from the test device within the building fails to deliver intelligible audio or data to the appropriate public safety dispatch center or equivalent as would be expected during normal operation; and/or when a transmission from a public safety dispatch center or equivalent fails to deliver intelligible audio or data to the test device within the building as would be expected during normal operation.

P105.5 FCC compliance.

The emergency responder radio coverage system installation and components shall also comply with all applicable federal regulations including FCC 47 CFR Part 90.219.

P106 Maintenance.

The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be maintained operational at all times in accordance with Sections P106.1 through P106.4.

P106.1 Testing and proof of compliance.

The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be inspected and tested annually or whenever structural changes occur, including additions or remodels that could materially change the original field performance tests. Testing shall consist of the following:

1.	In-building coverage test as described in Section P105.3.

2.	Signal boosters in-building coverage systems shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance.

3.	Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If, within the one-hour test period, the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined.

4.	All other active components shall be checked to verify operation within the manufacturer’s specifications.

5.	At the conclusion of the testing, a report, which shall verify compliance with Section P105.3, shall be submitted to the fire code official.

P106.2 Additional frequencies.

The building owner shall modify or expand the emergency responder radio coverage system at their expense in the event frequency changes are required by the FCC or additional frequencies are made available by the FCC, or public safety entities operating in a given jurisdiction make modifications, changes, or upgrades to their communication system(s) that change the frequencies such systems utilize. Prior approval of a public safety radio coverage system on previous frequencies does not exempt this section.

P106.3 Field testing.

Agency personnel shall have the right to enter onto the property at any reasonable time to conduct field testing to verify the required level of radio coverage.

P106.4 Planned outages.

Any planned outages of the in-building coverage system, such as for replacement or upgrade of the system, shall be done with the written approval of an entity legitimately representing public safety agencies operating within the jurisdiction, such as a county sheriff.
