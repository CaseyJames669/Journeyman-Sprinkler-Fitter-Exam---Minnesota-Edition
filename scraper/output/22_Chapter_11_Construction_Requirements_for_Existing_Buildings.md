# Chapter 11 Construction Requirements for Existing Buildings

About this chapter:Chapter 11 applies toexistingbuildings constructed prior to the adoption of the code and is intended to ensure a minimum degree of fire and life safety to persons occupyingexistingbuildings by providing foralterationsto such buildings that do not comply with the minimum requirements of theInternational Building Code®.The provisions address general fire safety features such as requirements forfire alarm systemsin someexistingbuildings and generalmeans of egress, and include a section dedicated toexistingGroupI-2occupancies.

The following terms are defined inChapter 2:

Forinterior finishes, interior trim, furniture, furnishings,decorative materialsand decorative vegetation inexistingbuildings, see MSFC Sections803through808.

See optionalAppendix Pfor Emergency Responder Radio
