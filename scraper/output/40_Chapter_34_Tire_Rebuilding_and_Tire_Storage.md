# Chapter 34 Tire Rebuilding and Tire Storage

About this chapter:Chapter 34 provides requirements that are intended to prevent or control fires andexplosionsassociated with the remanufacture and storage of tires and tire by-products. Additionally, the requirements are intended to minimize the impact ofindoorand outdoor tire storage fires by regulating pile volume and location, segregating the various operations, providing for fire departmentaccessand a water supply, and controlling ignition sources.

Permitsshall be required as set forth inSection 105.6.

Buffing operations shall be located in a room separated from the remainder of the building housing the tire rebuilding or tire recapping operations by a 1-hourfire barrier.

Exception:Buffing operations are not required to be separated where all of the following conditions are met:Buffing operations are equipped with anapprovedcontinuousautomaticwater-spraysystemdirected at the point of cutting action.Buffing machines are connected to particle-collectingsystemsproviding a minimum air movement of 1,500 cubic feet per minute (cfm) (0.71 m3/s) in volume and 4,500 feet per minute (fpm) (23 m/s) in-line velocity.The collectingsystemshall discharge the rubber particles to anapprovedoutdoor noncombustible or fire-resistantcontainerthat is emptied at frequent intervals to prevent overflow.

Exception:Buffing operations are not required to be separated where all of the following conditions are met:

- Buffing operations are equipped with anapprovedcontinuousautomaticwater-spraysystemdirected at the point of cutting action.
- Buffing machines are connected to particle-collectingsystemsproviding a minimum air movement of 1,500 cubic feet per minute (cfm) (0.71 m3/s) in volume and 4,500 feet per minute (fpm) (23 m/s) in-line velocity.
- The collectingsystemshall discharge the rubber particles to anapprovedoutdoor noncombustible or fire-resistantcontainerthat is emptied at frequent intervals to prevent overflow.

Where the bulk volume of stored product is more than 150,000 cubic feet (4248 m3), storage arrangement shall be in accordance with the following:

- Individual storage piles shall comply with size and separation requirements in Sections3405.1through3405.5.
- Adjacent storage piles shall be considered to be a group, and the aggregate volume of storage piles in a group shall not exceed 150,000 cubic feet (4248 m3).

Separation between groups shall be not less than 75 feet (22 860 mm) wide.
